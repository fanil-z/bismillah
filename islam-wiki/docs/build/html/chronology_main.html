<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Saleh (Selah?) and people of Thamud</a><a class="headerlink" href="#saleh-selah-and-people-of-thamud" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Thamud were a tribal confederation in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mentioned in Assyrian sources in the time of Sargon II. The tribe’s name continues to appear in documents into the fourth century CE, but by the sixth century they were regarded as a group that had vanished long ago.
According to the Quran, the city that Saleh was sent to was called al-Hijr, which corresponds to the Nabataean city of Hegra. The city rose to prominence around the first century AD as an important site in the regional caravan trade. Adjacent to the city were large, decorated rock-cut tombs used by members of various religious groups.</p>
<p>Saleh’s life in his community had been so righteous that the people of Thamud virtually relied upon him for support. He was chosen by God as a Messenger and sent to preach against the selfishness of the wealthy and to condemn the practice of Shirk (Idolatry or Polytheism). Although Saleh preached the message for a sustained period of time, the people for Thamud refused to hear his warning and instead began to ask Saleh to perform a miracle for them. They said: “O Salih! Thou hast been of us! A centre of our hopes hitherto! Dost thou forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshiped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us.”</p>
<p>Saleh reminded his people of the countless castles and palaces they built out of stone, and of their technological superiority over neighboring communities. Furthermore, he told them about their ancestors, the ʿĀd tribe, and how they too were destroyed for their sins. Some of the people of Thamud believed Saleh’s words, but the tribal leaders refused to listen to him and continued to demand that he demonstrate a miracle to prove his prophethood.</p>
<p>In response, God gave the Thamud a blessed she-camel, as both a means of sustenance and a test. The tribe was told to allow the camel to graze peacefully and avoid harming her. But in defiance of Saleh’s warning, the people of the tribe hamstrung the camel. Saleh informed them that they had only three more days to live before the wrath of God descended upon them. The people of the city were remorseful, but their crime could not be undone, and all the disbelieving people in the city were killed in an earthquake. Al-Hijr was rendered uninhabited and remained in ruins for all time thereafter. Saleh himself and the few believers who followed him survived.</p>
<p>The story is expanded upon in Sūrat an-Naml, whilst the she-camel is not mentioned explicitly here, it states that nine men plotted to kill Salih and his whole family, a crime for which they were struck down by God 3 days later.</p>

<p>Ibrahim was born in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called ‘Ur’ in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion.</p>
<p>His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ebrahem would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always scold him for not following his ancestors’ rituals and mocking their idols.</p>
<p>When Ibrahim was young he used to laugh whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.</p>

<p>One night, Abraham went up to the mountain, leaned against a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, “Could this be my Lord?” But when it set he said: “I don’t like those that set.” The star had disappeared so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, “Could this be my Lord?” but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, “Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!” But when the sun also set he said, “O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set.” After this declaration, Abraham then heard Allah calling him, “O Abraham ” Abraham trembled and said, “Here I am O my Lord!” Allah replied, “Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!”Abraham fell to the ground, crying. He said: “I submit to the Lord of the universe!” Abraham kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.</p>

Abraham was invited to attend the festivities, but he excused himself, and then he destroyed all idols in the temple and left only the biggest one. after people came back and accused Ibrahim of destroying idols, he said that that biggest one did it.</p>

<p>Ayyub came after Yusuf. The Quran describes Job as a righteous servant of Allah, who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Job never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer, asking Him to remove his affliction:
And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, “Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful.” — Quran, sura 21 (The Prophets), ayah 83</p>
<p>The narrative goes on to state that after many years of suffering, God ordered Job to “Strike with thy foot!”.[6] At once, Job struck the ground with his foot and God caused a cool spring of water to gush forth from the Earth, from which Job could replenish himself. The Quran states that it was then that God removed his pain and suffering and He returned Job’s family to him, blessed him with many generations of children and granted him great wealth. In addition to the brief descriptions of Job’s narrative, the Quran further mentions Job twice in the lists of those whom God had given special guidance, wisdom and inspiration (IV: 163) and as one of the men who received authority, the gift of prophethood (VI:84).</p>
<p>After Satan has given up trying to turn Job away from the Lord, God removed Job’s affliction and returned his family to him, doubling them in number. He returned Job’s wealth and showered Job with gold. Once Job’s wife had seen her husband restored to prosperity and health, she prayed thanks to God but then worried over the oath her husband had taken earlier, in which he had promised to beat her with a hundred strokes. Job was also deeply grieved over the oath he had taken, amidst his suffering. God, however, sent a revelation to Job, which told him to not beat his wife but to gently hit her with a bundle of soft grass.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id21">Shu’ayb (Jethro?)</a><a class="headerlink" href="#shu-ayb-jethro" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Qur’an states that Shuaib was appointed by God to be a prophet to the people of Midian. The people of this land were said to be especially notorious for cheating others through dishonesty and for idolatry. Shuʿayb’s prophecy mainly involved calling the Midianites to the correct path of God, and forbidding them to worship false gods.</p>
<p>It is also said he told his people to stop being dishonest in their daily activities. Although he preached and prophesied for a sustained period of time, the majority of the people refused to listen to him. Shuayb, however, remained steadfast. He consistently preached powerfully against the wicked, telling them of the punishment that had befallen the sinful before them. Shuʿayb warned the people that their ignorance would lead to the destruction of Midian, giving historical examples of earlier prophets, including Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot, all of whose people had been destroyed by God.</p>
<p>The people taunted Shuʿayb and told him that, were it not for the prestigious family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuayb replied, “Is my family of more consideration with you than God?” When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur’an, however, mentions that Shuʿayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment.</p>

<p>After introducing idols, Jews ceased to visit the temple of Abraham. Jurhumites from Yemen were rulers of Mecca for some time. They started committing injustice and were finally driven out. Before going, they buried Zamzam in the sand. A chieftan from Kuza’ah when coming back from Syria asked the Moabites(or the giants tribe) to give him one of their idols. They gave him Hubal, which he brought back to sanctuary, setting it up within the Ka’bah itself; and it became the chief idol of Mecca.</p>

<p>Arabia at that time was between two greatest super empires the Byzantine and Persian, who were fighting against each other for 400 years. and within 30 years after the prophet Muhammad saw died, Arabs conquered both of these empires.
they did not have buildings, they did not even have a government. they were never united. by modern historic scholars considers this as the same if modern Escimoes conquerred Russia and USA.</p>

<p>Kinanah he was known for his bravery and wisdom. People would do hajj to meet Kinanah. 3 people have a founding role in founding Quraish.</p>
<p>WHen Khuzagha attacked Jurhum, Jurhum hid the Zamzam before they leave.</p>
<p>At that time, Khuzagha was controlling Mecca. he married chieftan’s daughter and after the chieftan died, people wanted Qusayy to take over so he united Quraish tribes and fought against sons of Khuzagha chieftan and reclaimed the control over Mecca for the Quraish.</p>
<p>The great-great-greatfather of the Prophet Muhammad saw. after battles it was agreed that Qusay from Quraish must be the guardian of the Kaaba. They were receiving taxes, feeding the pilgrims and living in tents. Qusayy told them to build houses. His hidden qualities enabled him to establish his superiority over the Makkans and especially the tribe of Quraysh. Within a short time he acquired the high governmental offices in Makkah and also became the custodian of the keys of the Ka’bah and the undisputed ruler of that city.</p>
<p>Many remarkable events are associated with his name. One of these was that he encouraged the people to construct a house with the name of ‘Darun Nadwah’ adjacent to the Ka’bah and thus founded a Council Hall for the Arabs so that their dignitaries and chiefs might sit together in this public centre and solve their problems. He died in the 5th A.D. and left behind two sons named Abdud Dar and Abd Manaf.</p>

the silk road was going through Basra. So Hashim hooked to the Silk Road and connected Yemen and Basra. and in the middle was Mecca. and Mecca had people who would come to Hajj, so there was the market.</p>
<p>and it was a safe route because of Mecca was a holy sight.

<p>Humans are created between angels and animals. Angels dont have their own desires they only worship Allah. and animals are living on their instincts and dont worship Allah as the angels so.
and if human beings incline to instincts, they become worse than animals. and if they incline towards worshipping Allah, they become better than angels.
Adam was the last of Allah’s creations.</p>
<p>about 70 years ago there was a consensus in the scientific world that the universe is eternal, which contradicts the Quran that says Allah started the universe. and after 20 years more cosmic data came and scientists accepted that the Big Bang Theory make more sense.</p>
