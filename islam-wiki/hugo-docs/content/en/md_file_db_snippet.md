Wnted to combine the guide from interlinked separate parts where each definition can be source for its own wiki page. hugo has functionality for snippets but seemed like it would require one-level higher content planning and too much overhead so I chose the simplest way.


So, I want this one thing and I have no idea how to get there or even where to start.

The next thing that I want to experiment with is to try to build a rest API style documentation for the Quran verses and hadiths. Ideally, I want to have something like a database of each chapter, hadith, Islamic person or event with their metadata. The problem is that I would really need to manage that amount of information easily and through some unified console. I guess it seems like I want some combination of a static version of Wikipedia and a database.
Also we really need a proper markdown editor, like help and manual. That can combine you the whole guide with interlinked pages and without formatting stuff.

Mediawiki is a great invention that led to so many further projects and it is really cool but I personally think that it is too complicated. After realizing that you can do so many things without a web server but just with HTML, CSS and Javascript, I really started to like the simplicity of what's happening behind the building and hosting process.
Well, maybe the fact that I know very little about building a web server plays an significant role here as well.

I can post the question regarding the database wiki combination in tech writing groups.

And hosting a database means that you need a web server. So the problem is I want a database but I don't want a web server.

I'm sure some of these things already exist somewhere. Please tell me if you know where I can start digging.

As one of our leading developes said as devops is the future of programming, I believe that learning how to build your documentation from source files is an inevitable path for a technical writer.
