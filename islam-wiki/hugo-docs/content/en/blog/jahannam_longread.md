## Creation of Heaven and Hell

Jannah (Heaven) and Hell (Jahannam) were created before its future habitats. This means Hell and Heaven already exist now.

According to the Quran and ahadith, Jahannam seem to be a living creature that breathes, roars and has a natural desire to punish the transgressors and disbelievers.

 
Al-'Aqeedah al-Salafiyyah by at-Tahhaawi:
"Paradise and Hell have already been created. They will never come to an end or cease to exist. Allah (swt) created Paradise and Hell before the rest of creation, and He (swt) created inhabitants for each of them. Whoever He (swt) wishes (will enter) Paradise by His grace and mercy, and whoever He (swt) wishes (will enter Hell) as a result of His (swt) justice. Every person will behave according to that for which he was created, and his destiny will be that for which he was created; good deeds and evil deeds are foreordained for all men".

>Abu Hurairah [ra] narrated that the Messenger of Allah [saw] said:
>"When Allah created Jannah and Hellfire, He sent Gabriel to Jannah, saying, ‚Äòlook at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.‚Äô 
>
>So Gabriel went to it and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants. Then Gabriel returned to Allah and said, ‚ÄòBy Your glory, no one hears of it without entering it.‚Äô 
>
> So Allah ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and
> He said, ‚ÄòReturn to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants! So, Gabriel returned to it and found that it was surrounded by forms of hardship. Then he returned to Allah and said, ‚ÄòBy Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it, Allah said, ‚ÄòGo to Hellfire and look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.‚Äô Gabriel found that it was in layers, one above the other.
> Then Gabriel returned to Allah and said, ‚ÄòBy Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.‚Äô 
>
> So Allah ordered that it be surrounded by lusts. Then He said, ‚ÄòReturn to it and Gabriel returned to it and said, ‚ÄòBy Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.‚Äô

### Physical essense of sin

Partly From the narration of Malik ibn Dinar and hiw daughter who hushed away the dragon that was chasing her father. we can derive that good deeds and sins of people are some physical entities. Somehow these entities are combined for your punishment or your blessing in the hereafter.

for example, there is also a hadith that says each dhikr is a real seed of your tree in Jannah. 

Every person is only getting the result of what he has done in this dunya. His own punishment is build from his sins which with the design of Allah obtained a certain form in Jahannam. Jahannam is designed in a way that collects all your sins and 

The law of energy conservation. When you push a button the button pushes you. 
Allahu 'Alim, we will now know the true nature of sin until the Day of Judgement but we can try to extrapolate the law of physics to matters such as injustice, good and corruption. The laws of physics, maths and everything that happens in nature is architected and  programmed by Allah.
So the theory is that when a man creates a tiniest injustice, some law of this universe creates some kind of energy or entity that opposes this injustice. And this little portion of justice is stored in some storing place which our human eyes cannot see and mind cannot comprehend. And Allah is the Bestower of Ultimate Justice, and the man who transgressed can get this justice during his lifetime on Earth üåé , in this case if he gets the full punishment in this dunya, then he is not punished for this sin in the hereafter because there is no this entity or substance left that can be used as a fuel for his misdeed.
This also would explain the statement from the Quran that says whatever good a human earns is from Allah, and whatever bad a human earns is from the human himself.
Let's emphasize this: The default state of this world is a just world. So in theory, if a man disturbs this scale of justice, then the scale shakes and and creates an opposing power. But if a man does not transgress and does not create injustice, then in theory a man doesn't get a special reward for it, except for the fact that he will not the punishment for the transgression. We can derive this from the law of preserving energy. You can say that living in a just world is enough of a reward itself and it's true but the world is not just and probably will never be until the Day of Recompence. So let's say there is an ultimately good human being who never in his life committed sin and injustice, then he will not be able to get his recompence in this dunya because the world is unjust and corrupt. But Allah is ar Rahman ar Rahim, and He created a system where each attempt of staying in being just and good (aka staying in the default state) is recorded so that this human can get a reward for following the rules of Allah.
There is also another matter that must be contemplated. We talked about a human making some action. But this dies not Cover the whole scope of human interaction with this dunya. A human not only can interfere entities but some other human beings or animals, bacteria, natural elements can affect him as well swindling the scale of justice to one or the other direction. So someone can create injustice upon a man. And even this man is not guilty, some injustice will timely be bestowed upon him. 
This would explain the authentic hadith that people on the Day of Judgement will run to one another gathering good deeds of one another. Somehow these entities would start be become visible to us and we will be able to distinguish them and take from each other.


This is the explanation of the statement that people go to Jahannam because of sins that that have committed but he enters Jannah only because of the Mercy of Allah. According to this system, it seems like there shouldn't be any reward for being good because it is the default state of the universe. But Allah gives us the reward out of his Mercy.


consider bad politic leader and how their opposition appears.

"[So it was], until when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, "Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed." But none had believed with him, except a few."
(QS. Hud 11: Verse 40)

I don't know the exact meaning in Arabic but I would like to pay attention to the phrase "and the oven overflowed". This is an example of what is happening when the amount of sins grows too large. and only Allah knows how much is too much.

This closely intersects with another topic I wanted to analyze as a longread, which is why wars happen. 

### Reality of Jahannam

Easy Entrance: ‚ÄúParadise is surrounded by difficulties and Fire is surrounded by temptations‚Äù [Bukhari].

Eternal: "O Jannatis, now there will be no death; O Jahannamis now there will be no death; On hearing this call , the Jannatis will be delighted and the Jahanamis will become more depressed." [Bukhari] 

Depth: "If a rock is dropped into Jahannam, it will remain plummeting for 70 years before touching the pith of Jahannam". [Muslim]

4 Walls: "Four walls surround Jahannam. The width of each wall is a walking distance of 40 years". 

7 Gates: "Jahannam has seven gates; one of them is for the one who unsheathes a sword against my Ummah." [Mishkat] 

Atmosphere: ‚ÄúJahannam was heated for a thousand years and its fire turned red; It was then heated for another thousand years and it became white; it was again heated for another thousand years and it turned black. At present, Jahannam is pitch black and dark." [Tirmidhi] "The fire in which one will burn is the 70th part of the Fire of Jahannam.‚Äù [Muslim]

7 Layers: Ali ibn Abi Talib (ra) has said that the gates of Jahannam are one upon each other. This denotes that Jahannam has layers. "The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire." [Qur'an 4:145]. 

Hutama: According to some narrations, the deepest level of the Hells. It is for the Hypocrites (Munafiqin)
The great Mufassirin al-Qurtubi says, "This topic indicates that the kufr of the person who simply disbelieves is not like the kufr of a person who oppresses, disbelieves, rebels and disobeys. There is no doubt that the kuffaar will suffer different levels of punishment in hell, as is known from Qur'aan and Sunnah. We know for certain that the punishment of those who oppressed and killed the Prophets and Muslims, and spread corruption and disbelief on earth, will not be the same as the punishment of those who simply disbelieved, but treated the Prophets and Muslims well. Do you not see Abu Taalib, how the Prophet (saws) will bring him up to a shallow level of Hell, because he helped him, protected him and treated him well? The hadith narrated by Muslim from Samurah may be interpreted as referring to the kuffaar, as there is a hadith about Abu Taalib, or it may be interpreted as eferring to those monotheists who will be punished". [at-Tadhkirah]

Fuel: "Verily you, (Unbelievers) and the (false) gods that you worship besides Allah, are (but) fuel for Jahannam! To it will you (surely) come!" [Qur'an 21: 98] "O Muslims! Save yourselves and your families from the Fire whose fuel is men and stones." [Qur'an 66: 6] 

Ibn Mas'ud (ra) explained; "Stones, which are the fuel of Jahannam, are made of sulphur (brimstone) which Allah Ta'ala created in the nearest heaven on the day heaven and earth were created." [Hakim] 

Types of Punishments

Example;

Creatures: "Verily, there are long-necked camel-like snakes in Jahannam. If anyone of these smites a Jahanami , he will feel pain for 40 years‚Ä¶.Verily, there are donkey size scorpions in Jahannam. If anyone of these stings a Jahanami , he will feel pain for 40 years." [Ahmad] "On the Day of Resurrection, a neck will come out from Jahannam, having two eyes, two ears and one tongue to see, hear and speak. It will say that it has been designated for three types of persons: a. on every rebellious and stubborn one; b. on everyone who made an associate with Allah; and c. on the painter of a picture. [Tirmidhi]

Food: ‚ÄúBoiling water will be poured on their heads and it would pierce their skulls until it reaches their stomachs; this will make their guts melt and go down to their feet, then everything would be returned to its original condition again‚Äù [Ahmad]. ‚ÄúIndeed the tree of Zaqqum, is the food for the sinful. Like murky oil, it boils within bellies. Like the boiling of scalding water‚Äù (Ad-Dukhaan: 43-46). "The dwellers of Jahannam will experience such intense hunger, that this alone be equal to the terrible torment which will be rendered . Then they will seek for food and they will be given food that will stick to the throat (i.e. it will neither go in nor come out.)" [Mishkat] 

Iron and Chains: "In addition there will be rods of Iron (to punish) them. Every time they wish to get away therefrom, due to anguish, they will be forced back therein, and (it will be said). "Taste you the Chastisement of Burning!" [Qur'an 22:21-22]. "If the rod of iron is placed on the ground, all men and jinn put together will not lift it." [Ahmad] "But soon shall they know, when the yokes (shall be) round their necks, and the chains; they shall be dragged along, in the boiling stinging fluid; then in the Fire shall they be burned." [Qur‚Äôan 14:50]

Garments: "Their garments of pitch, and their faces covered with Fire." [Qur‚Äôan 14:50] According to Ibn Abbas (ra) 'qateran' is melted brass. Jahannamis will be made to wear this dress which is extremely hot. [Ibn Kathir]

Punishment on the bodily parts: "The Fire will burn their faces, and they will grin therein , with their lips displaced." [Qur‚Äôan] ‚ÄúThe dwellers of Hell will cry so much that ships can sail in their tears, and their tears will be of blood‚Äù [Hakim]. "Verily the tongue of the Unbelievers will be pulled out up to one or two 'fersakh' (three miles)and the people will walk over it." "The distance between two shoulders of an Unbeliever will be so wide that it will take three days if a mount covers it rapidly; his jaw-tooth will be equal to mount Uhad, and the thickness of his skin will be equal to the passage of three days." [Muslim] "Those who reject Our Signs. We shall soon hurl into the Fire: As often as their skins are roasted through, We shall replace these for fresh skins, that they may taste the chastisement:, for Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise." [Qur'an 4: 56]. ‚ÄúThe least among the people of Hell in punishment is one whose sandals and laces are of fire from which his brain boils as a pot of water would boil (when set on fire), he will not think that there is anyone being punished more than him, but in reality, he is the least in punishment‚Äù [Bukhari]

Some Actions which take you to Jahannam

Example;

Those who are weak to avoid evil: ‚ÄúThe inmates of Hell are of five types: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil)‚Äù [Muslim]

Those who conceal knowledge: "Anyone who conceals when asked whilst having knowledge, will have a bridle of Fire in his mouth." [Mishkat] 

Those who drink khamr: "Allah has made a vow that anyone who drinks any intoxicating thing will be made to drink "tinatul khabul " on the Day of Resurrection. "The Companions (ra) submitted" "What is "tinatul khabul"?" He explained: "It is the sweat of the Jahannamis." [Mishkat] 

Those who eat Haram food: "Flesh which has grown out of what is unlawful will not enter Paradise, but Hell is more fitting for all flesh which has grown out of what is unlawful." [Tirmidhi]

Those who advise others but do not practice themselves: "On the night of Ascension I saw some people whose lips were going to be cut with the scissors of Fire. I asked: "O Jabrael ,who are they?" "These are those preachers of your Ummah who called for righteous deeds and forgot about themselves; they read and recited the Book of Allah but did not put it into practice." [Mishkat] "On the Day of Qiyamat, a person will be brought and hurled into Jahannam. His intestines will come out immediately and he will start evolving like the ass with the grinding stone. Having seen this, the men of Jahannam will centre around him and ask: "What happened to you? You asked us to do good and avoid evil?" "Yes, of course! I asked you to do good and avoid evil but did not do so myself." 

Those who boast of their deeds: "Seek refuge with Allah from the well of sorrows." "What is this well of sorrows?" The Companions (ra) asked He explained: "There is a ditch in Jahannam, which is such that Jahannam itself seeks refuge from it 400 times a day." "The devouts who repeatedly boast their virtues deeds will be there.‚Äù [Mishkat]

Those who give a verdict based upon his mind: ‚ÄúHe who introduces an opinion related to the Qur‚Äôan based on his ‚ÄòAql he will reserve for himself a place in the Hell-fire‚Äù [Bukhari]

Those who miss their Prayers: ‚ÄúWhat has caused you to enter Hell?‚Äô They will say: "We were not of those who used to offer their Salat (prayers)‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan 74: 42-43]

Those who use Gold and Silver utensils to eat and drink: ‚ÄúOne who eats and drinks in the utensils of gold and silver or the utensils having something of these metals will have his stomach filled with the Fire of Jahannam‚Äù [Darqutni] 

Those who draw Pictures that have soul: "Every picture maker will be in Jahannam; his pictures will be changed into a living figure who will then give punishment to him." [Bukhari]

Those who commit Suicide: "He who commits suicide by throttling shall keep on throttling himself in the Hell Fire (forever) and he who commits suicide by stabbing himself shall keep on stabbing himself in the Hell-Fire." [Bukhari]

Those who are arrogant: "The arrogants will be raised in the forms of ants, having the body of ants and faces of humans. They will be driven towards the jail of Jahannam very disgracefully." [Mishkat] 

Those who break family ties: "The person who severs the bond of kinship will not enter Paradise." [Bukhari]

Those of the women who are disobedient to their husbands: ‚ÄúI was shown Hell and I have never seen anything more terrifying than it. And I saw that the majority of its people are women.‚Äù They said, ‚ÄúWhy, O Messenger of Allaah?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúBecause of their ingratitude (kufr).‚Äù It was said, ‚ÄúAre they ungrateful to Allaah?‚Äù He said, ‚ÄúThey are ungrateful to their companions (husbands) and ungrateful for good treatment. If you are kind to one of them for a lifetime then she sees one (undesirable) thing in you, she will say, ‚ÄòI have never had anything good from you.‚Äô‚Äù [Bukhari]

Reality of Jannah

Unimaginable: "Allah says: I have readied for my righteous servants such provision which the eye has never seen, the ear has never heard of, the human mind has never imagined of" [Muslim]

Unchanged: ‚ÄúThe description of Paradise which the Muttaqun have been promised is that in it are rivers of water the taste and smell of which are not changed; rivers of milk of which the taste never changes; rivers of wine delicious to those who drink; and rivers of clarified honey (clear and pure) therein for them is every kind of fruit; and forgiveness from their Lord‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan 47:15]

8 Gates: "Paradise has eight gates, and one of them is called Ar-Raiyan through which none will enter but those who observe fasting." [Bukhari] "By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham)." [Bukhari]. ‚ÄúThe person that contributes a set of clothing in the path of Allah, will be called forth by the doors of Jannah "O servant of Allah! come hither! Those who engaged in salat (abundantly) will be beckoned by the "Door of Salat"; ‚ÄúThose regular in jihad will be beckoned by the "Door of Jihad" Those generous in charity will be beckoned by the "Door of Charity". Abu Bakr (ra) thereupon asked if there would be any person whom all the doors of Jannah will beckon? He replied that he hoped Abu Bakr (ra) would be amongst such persons (whom all the doors of Jannah would beckon.) [Bukhari]

1 Bab al-Iman; 2 Bab al-Jihad; 3 Bad al-Kadhemean al Gaidh; 4 Bab ar-Raiyan; 5 Bab ar-Radiyeen; 6 Bab as-Sadaqah 7 Bab at-Taubah; and 8 Bab as-Salat.

100 Levels: There are 100 levels (storeys) in Jannah that Allah has created for those who strive in His path and the distance between each of these is similar to that between the earth and the sky; (therefore). Whenever you ask Jannah of Allah, ask for Jannatul- Firdaus because it is the highest and focal point of Jannah. Upon it is the Arsh of Allah and in it is the source of the rivers of Jannah. [Bukhari] "The people of Paradise will look at the dwellers of the lofty mansions (i.e. a superior place in Paradise) in the same way as one looks at a brilliant star far away in the East or in the West on the horizon; all that is because of their superiority over one another (in rewards)." On that the people said, "O Allah's Apostle! Are these lofty mansions for the prophets which nobody else can reach? The Prophet replied," No! "By Allah in whose Hands my life is, these are for the men who believed in Allah and also believed in the Apostles." [Bukhari] "Rise to enter Paradise whose width is equal to the Heavens and the Earth." [Muslim]

Tents, Thrones, Gardens, Utensils, Rivers and Trees: "In Paradise there is a tent made of a single hollow pearl sixty miles wide, in each corner of which there are wives who will not see those in the other corners; and the believers will visit and enjoy them. And there are two gardens, the utensils and contents of which are made of silver; and two other gardens, the utensils and contents of which are made of so-and-so (i.e. gold) and nothing will prevent the people staying in the Garden of Eden from seeing their Lord except the curtain of Majesty over His Face." [Bukhari] Sayhan, Jayhan, Euphrates and Nile are all among the rivers of Paradise. [Muslim] "In Paradise there is a tree which is so big that a rider can travel in its shade for one hundred years without passing it; and if you wish, you can recite [Bukhari]

First Person to Enter: ‚ÄúOn the day of Qiyamah I will wish to open the doors of Jannah. The doorkeeper will say to me; Who are you? I will reply: Muhammad. He will then say: I have been commanded to open the doors for you alone. I will not open the door for anyone before you. [Muslim]

Last Person to Enter: "I know the person who will be the last to come out of the (Hell) Fire, and the last to enter Paradise. He will be a man who will come out of the (Hell) Fire crawling, and Allah will say to him, ‚ÄòGo and enter Paradise.‚Äô He will go to it, but he will imagine that it had been filled, and then he will return and say, ‚ÄòO Lord, I have found it full.‚Äô Allah will say, ‚ÄòGo and enter Paradise, and you will have what equals the world and ten times as much (or, you will have as much as ten times the like of the world).‚Äô On that, the man will say, ‚ÄòDo you mock at me (or laugh at me) though You are the King?" I saw Allah‚Äôs Apostle (while saying that) smiling that his premolar teeth became visible. It is said that will be the lowest in degree amongst the people of Paradise.[Bukhari] ‚ÄúThe lowest of people in status in Paradise will be a man whose face Allah turns away from the Fire towards Paradise, and shows him a tree giving shade. He will say, ‚ÄòO Lord, bring me closer to that tree so that I may be in its shade‚Ä¶ Then he will enter his house [in Paradise] and his two wives from among al-hoor al-‚Äòiyn will come in and will say to him, ‚ÄòPraise be to Allah who brought you to life for us and brought us to life for you.‚Äô Then he will say, ‚ÄòNo one has been given what I have been given.‚Äô‚Äù [Muslim]

First Group to Enter: The first group to enter Jannah will have illuminated faces like the full moon; Those to follow them will have shining faces like stars of the sky; They will not urinate or defecate there, nor will they spit or need to blow their noses; They will have combs of gold; Their perspiration will have the fragrance of musk; They will have "Oode-Hindi" (a type of fragrant wood) as a fumigant; They will have beautiful, big-eyed damsels as their wives; Their behaviour and character will be uniform; They will resemble their progenitor, Adam (as) in height. [Bukhari] "Verily! 70,000 or 700,000 of my followers will enter Paradise altogether; so that the first and the last amongst them will enter at the same time, and their faces will be glittering like the bright full moon." [Bukhari]

The lowest and the highest in Jannah: ‚ÄúMusa (as) enquired from Allah Ta'ala: Who will be the lowest Jannati? He replied: The person who will reach Jannah after everyone else had entered therein. It will be said to him: You may enter now. He will say: O Lord! how can I, now that the people have occupied all the space and claimed all it's possessions? It will be said to him: Does it please you that you will be granted a kingdom equal to the kingdom of a worldly king? He will reply: I am satisfied. It will then be said to him: You will be granted this and so much more and so much more and so much more. At the fifth time, he will exclaim: O my Lord! I am pleased with this much! Allah Ta'ala will then say to him: You will be granted this much and tenfold more and you will be granted that which your heart desires and that which pleases your eye! He will reply: O my Lord! I am well-pleased. Thereafter Musa (as) enquired regarding the highest Jannati? It was replied: He will be my chosen and beloved one. I have prepared all honour and status for him and set a seal upon it; I have prepared that which no eye has observed, no ear has ever heard and no mind has ever perceived.‚Äù [Muslim]

The Ten Companions who were given Paradise: ‚ÄúAbu Bakr will be in Paradise, ‚ÄòUmar will be in Paradise, ‚ÄòUthmaan will be in Paradise, ‚ÄòAli will be in Paradise, Talhah will be in Paradise, al-Zubayr will be in Paradise, ‚ÄòAbd al-Rahmaan ibn ‚ÄòAwf will be in Paradise, Sa‚Äôd (ibn Abi Waqqaas) will be in Paradise, Sa‚Äôeed (ibn Zayd) will be in Paradise, and Abu ‚ÄòUbaydah ibn al-Jarraah will be in Paradise.‚Äù [Tirmidhi]

Reality of the Inhabitants of Paradise

No Waste or Suffering: ‚ÄúThe inmates of Paradise would eat and drink but would neither spit, nor pass water, nor void excrement, nor suffer catarrh. [Muslim]

Everlasting Youth, Prestige and Beauty: ‚ÄúHe who would get into Paradise (would be made to enjoy such an everlasting) bliss that he would neither become destitute, nor would his clothes wear out, nor his youth would decline‚Äù [Muslim]. There would be an announcer (in Paradise) who would make this announcement: Verily! there is in store for you (everlasting) health and that you should never fall ill and that you live (forever) and do not die at all. And that you would remain young and never grow old. And that you would always live in affluent circumstances and never become destitute, as words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, are: "And it would be announced to them: This is the Paradise. You have been made to inherit it for what you used to do." [Muslim]

Hairless and Young: "The inhabitants of Paradise will enter Paradise hairless, beardless with their eyes anointed with collyrium, aged thirty or thirty-three years."[Tirmidhi]

Wearing Bracelets and Silk: Truly, Allah will admit those who believe (in tawhid ) and do righteous good deeds, to Gardens underneath which rivers flow (in Paradise), wherein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be of silk. [Qur‚Äôan 22: 23]

No ill feeling in their breast and they will be on thrones: ‚ÄúTruly! The Muttaqun will be amidst Gardens and water-springs (Paradise). (It will be said to them): 'Enter therein (Paradise), in peace and security.' "And We shall remove from their breasts any sense of injury (that they may have), (So they will be like) brothers facing each other on thrones.‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan 15: 45-47]

Be Joyful and have fruits of every kind: Verily, the dwellers of the Paradise, that Day, will be busy in joyful things. They and their wives will be in pleasant shade, reclining on thrones. They will have therein fruits (of all kinds) and all that they ask for. [Qur‚Äôan 36: 55-57]

Be served and will not feel any agony: ‚ÄúIn the Gardens of delight (Paradise)‚Ä¶ They will be served by immortal boys, With cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine, Where from they will get neither any aching of the head, nor any intoxication‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan 56: 12 -19]

Not hear any false talk: ‚ÄúIn the Gardens of delight (Paradise)‚Ä¶ No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech (like backbiting, etc.). But only the saying of: Salam!, Salam!‚Äù. [Qur‚Äôan 56: 12-26]

Abide therein forever with peace and security: ‚ÄúEnter you therein in peace and security; this is a Day of eternal life!" There they will have all that they desire, and We have more‚Äù [Qur‚Äôan 50: 34-35]

Be given more power to enjoy the pleasures with their wives: ‚ÄúThe believer will be given great sexual potency in Jannah. He will be granted potency equal to that of a hundred men‚Äù [Bukhari]. ‚ÄúThe person that enters Jannah will be in perpetual Pleasures, Never will he be afflicted in anyway, Nor will his clothing wear away and Never will he loose his youth. [Muslim]

Their wives will sing melodiously: ‚ÄúThe women of Jannah will sing so melodiously for their husbands, that the human ear has never heard such melody. Amongst their songs will be the following verses: "We are the chosen beauties, Wives of most honourable husbands, Who look with the coolness of eyes, Who are perpetual, never dying, Who are chaste, never feared, Ever present, never absent." [Bukhari]

Gatherings in the pond of Kauthar with the Rasulillah (saws): Do you know what is "Hauze-Kauthar" (The pond of Kauthar)? It is a pond granted to me by my Rabb in Jannah It will be very blessed, My Ummah will gather at it to meet me, It's cups equal the stars in quantity‚Äù [Bukhari]

Gatherings in Markets: ‚ÄúThere will be a marketplace in Jannah, where the people of Jannah will gather every Friday. A fantastic breeze will blow and sprinkle splendour upon their faces and clothing; as a result, they will look even more beautiful and attractive than before. When their wives will see them in this splendid condition, they will exclaim: By Allah! You look more handsome than when you departed from us. They will reply: Even your beauty has increased greatly‚Äù [Muslim]

Some Actions which take you to Jannah

Example,

Those who receive the Mercy of Allah: None of you would get into Paradise because of his good deeds alone and he would not be rescued from Fire, not even I, but because of the Mercy of Allah. [Muslim]

Those who preserve their covenant and pray on time: Those who are faithfully true to their trusts and to their covenants; And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) prayers (at their fixed stated hours). These are indeed the inheritors. Who shall inherit the Firdaus (Paradise). They shall dwell therein forever. [Qur‚Äôan 23: 8-11]

Those who do the Sunnah prayers: ‚ÄúWhoever prays twelve rak'at during the day and night will have a house built for him in paradise: four rak'at before zuhr and two after it, two rak'at after Maghrib, two rak'at after 'isha, and two rak'at before fajr.‚Äù [Tirmidhi]

Those who were Poor amongst the Muslims: "I looked at Paradise and found poor people forming the majority of its inhabitants‚Äù [Bukhari]

Those Muslim rulers who were just: The inmates of Paradise are of three types: one who wields authority and is just and fair‚Äù [Muslim]

Those who are kind to relatives and do not beg: The inmates of Paradise are of three types: ‚Ä¶the person who is merciful and kind-hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and who does not stretch out his hand in spite of having a large family to support.‚Äô [Muslim]

Those who are Righteous: "Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise. And a man keeps on telling the truth until he becomes a truthful person.‚Äù [Bukhari]

Those of the Jihad Fighters: "Nobody who enters Paradise likes to go back to the world even if he got everything on the earth, except a Mujahid who wishes to return to the world so that he may be martyred ten times because of the dignity he receives (from Allah)." [Bukhari]

Those who build a Mosque: ‚ÄúWhoever builds for Allah a mosque, even if it be tiny, like a bird's nest, Allah will build for him a house in paradise‚Äù [Ahmed]

Please forgive me for any mistakes in this compilation and please feel free to point them out. Truly the good is from Allah (swt). 

I end with the following supplication:

O Allah, I ask you for all good, that which I am aware of and that which I am not. I seek refuge in You from all evil, that which I am aware of and that which I am not. O Allah, I ask you for the good that your devoted servants asked for. I seek refuge in You from all evil, that which I am aware of and that which I am not. O Allah, I ask you for the good that your devoted servants asked for. I seek refuge in You from the evil that your devoted servants sought refuge for. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the torment of the grave, from the trials of the ad-Dajjal, and from the trials of life and death. O Allah, I seek refuge in You from sin and debt. O Allah, give us all the good of this world, and the good of the life hereafter, and save us from the punishment of the fire.
