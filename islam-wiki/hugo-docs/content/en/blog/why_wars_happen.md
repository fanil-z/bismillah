1 layer: the surface layer
2 layer: geopolitics
3 layer: Ponzi Scheme
4 layer: Oldest Trick in History of Humanity

3 layer: personal place and role
4 layer: Islamic view which is the most important



The very first question that comes to mind "How did that happen?" and "How come some people appear who want war?". 


# First Layer

On the surface layer, any war is bad because it causes death and destruction. Innocent civilian people also often suffer from the war directly or indirectly, they may be killed, robbed, their houses and belongings may be destroyed, they may have to leave their home for a safer place, etc.
Islam allows to fight only against the one who opresses you.

There is a concept of Jihad in Islam which is translated as "a sacred war" and which is very often misunderstood. To understand jihad, one must read about the biography of the prophet Muhammad sww. 
In general there are several stages of jihad.

1. Jihad of Heart
First and the main stage of jihad is the continuous battle against your Nafs, against your own desires. Until you perfect your religion and character according to Islamic rules, you cannot go to the next step of jihad.

2. Jihad of Tongue

Jihad of tongue means telling people to try to correct people in their actions, teach them the right way from the islamic perspective and call people to worship Allah. It may also be reffered as da'wah.

If we analyze the life of the prophet Muhammad, we can derive the ideal plan of doing da'wah. 

Jihad of tongue has several stages within itself.

The very important thing before you start telling people that they are wrong is to be sure that you are not doing those things yourself. So, without winning the battle against your desires, you cannot tell people how they should behave.
Another important thing is to be knowlegable about the topic that you want to give da'wah. 

Then we can start calling our close people to islam. Relatives and firends. then friends of friends.
After mastering your character and religion, after surrounding yourself with close muslim friends and family members that support you, you can start doing public  da'wah.

For many of us people these two steps are the only battles that we need to fight. we cannot go further than that.


## Second Layer

in the daily life we tend to forget about geopolitic games and how governments work. al most all countries have armies some are really large. and the amount of rockets and bombs. 

Goverment works that
many people knew that it will eventually happen.

and about double standards of the western world.
wars happen all the time and ongoing and none of them are usually widely discussed. 
hunger exist all the time.


This is just about everything.
This starts with the war extrapolates to pretty much everything I could grasp out of my mind and inevitable ends up with a hadith and an view of this from a perspective of a Muslim.

If you dig into the core of human behavior.

There is a balance. If you control money and print it in whichever amount you like for your personal needs, you can expect that all other people who depend on the reserve currency will constantly get poorer and poorer. The problem of poverty in African countries is unsolvable with this kind of monetary system. And you start helping one country, the other country will fall. 

Of course we all know that wars are constantly ongoing but somehow sitting on our soft IKEA couches and searching for a new YouTube video while waiting for grocery deliveries we had this notion that in 21 century we already learned the lessons we have public Wikipedia any detail of history in the fingerclick. This is an illusion. There is a hadith that this dunya and everything that exists in this dunya is cursed. And the realization of this hadith we see in what is happening. we see all throughout human history. It just cannot exist in any other way. Maybe I don't understand something, but I don't see any other way of how this can be just. This is described in many analysis that modern monetary system is a Ponzi scheme. Tatarstan my homeland region in Russia became very famous for financial pyramids in the last years. The mechanism is the same, and the only difference is the scale. The larger the scale, the longer the pyramid can survive. In Russian realities, the most successful Pyramids lasted 3-4 years. The Madoff pyramid lasted 30 years? And it was only inside us. Extrapolate this into the whole range of nations and companies that use dollars. We can have a large number. And the other way to increase the longevity of a pyramid is to poverish less fortunate countries, which we see can be done easy-peasy.

And there rises the question of authority. Whose opinion we should rely on regarding our values and lifestyle. The answer is very simple. There is only one source of Ultimate Truth, Justice and Wisdom. Looking for the answers in so many directions, I've experienced this on myself. And started learning about Abrahamic religions and prophets and eventually this inevitably led me to the only path that kept and still keeping to gradually answer my questions. To Islam.

If you listen to those people who justify war, you can see that most of them are actually rooting for peace. They just had this deranged mind that thinks this peace can be done only by the interference of theMan they show on TV. The man who they say is pure good and solves the people problems.
And why do they have this wrong notion, this is another question.
I know i didn't connect all the dots because the chaos is too broad and includes many spheres in which I don't have expertise.
One of my friends who had experiences calls this connecting dots activity as "cocaine thing" because of the same effect. I suppose conspiracy theories derive in the same way when the corridor of knowledged spheres is narrow. 
That's the reason one should try to expand it as much as possible to see the other two hundred sides of the medallion.



Jordan Peterson type of monologue

And probably the last thing about conspiracy theories.  conspiracy theory believers have a bad reputation, they are laughed at for full-seriously creating a community of flat earth believers. But the majority of people miss a very subtle point. I would even say that it would be too humiliating for them to admit it and give it away. In many debates that I listen and opinions from dokinz Kraus and many others have a major common argument against religion. They say religion is created and shaped by smart governments to have control over the poor. And its not a conspiracy theory it has some truth in it and really happened in history in multiple occasions. Think of Paul's Christianity. Or Egyptian exploitation of Ra.
But this has some significant points to mention: First, it doesn't relate to Islam. If you don't believe it, just read the history of Islam and how the prophet Muhammad lived. and did he ever get the advantage of all the riches that started flowing to Medina after the prophet Muhammad sas unitied Arabian tribes.
Second, even if Christianity was widely used for political reasons it doesn't mean that is was originally created by the government. It was created by Jesus to whom God revealed His Word. Only later on in history  Christianity was reshaped and some detrimental changes came at the Nicean Creed, 300 years after Jesus pbuh left this world.

As many conspiracy theories it has some truth in it. But it must be parted. It is a crime to consider all religions together in this matter. They must be separated and analized independently

That's why when people see breaking news that us agreed to send bln dollar help to Ukraine, they should consider how a financial pyramid tries to save itself from destruction. For example, in the example of infamous finiko they worked with crypto currencies which gave them a gracious opportunity to expand to other countries especially post Soviet union where they don't have a language barrier and have loyal friends. So they found some guy who was eager to get rich and opened a local office in Kazakhstan. It became quiet popular and helped to accumulate money for some time.
By the way, fun fact. The head of self announced d republic is a former manager of another infamous financial pyramid mmm2. I'm not connecting the dots here, just a funny coincidence.
What I'm trying to say is that when your currency does not have a real value, it's price is calculated by the amount of ones who want to sell and buy it. The more countries use dollars the more liquidity you have in the system. On other words, they can print tonnes of money and send it to any country. The amount of real losses the us budget will see is the count of paper and ink used for printing. So, giving a country 1bln dollars is an illusion.
Expanding Nato is good example of how financial pyramid opens a new office.
Just think of the names Lockheat Martin and some other. There is a famous saying "Checkhov's gun" derived from the analysis of a A.Chekhov's stories that if the author is writing that there's is a rifle hanging on the wall in someone's house then later on in this novel, this rifle is going to fire. Think of budget funding of US military.

https://www.globalgiving.org/learn/how-much-would-it-cost-to-end-world-hunger/
Okay, so we got 267bln$ max considering the worst scenario. Let's google military budge of USA. And yes, it is bigger multiple times. "The approved 2019 Department of Defense discretionary budget is $686.1 billion". Let's go to what Bible Hosea 8:&says: "For they sow wind And they harvest a storm." If you hand over knives and bats to everyone in the room with scarse resources instead of proper education and moral standards, what can you expect this room to turn into several years later? A comfortable living zone?

Probably the president and those who stood behind disconnecting dollar from gold didn't have plans to pay their debts. Maybe they thought that even their grandchildren wont need to pay it.

Surprise layer.
It is horrible to witness how dozens of thousand people die and millions become poor being victims of politic and economic games.
But even this is not the final layer. Those big shots who try to rule the system and be in control of land territories and nations expect any treacherous moves from other participants of the game on other continents or a knife in the back from a sneaky companion, they probably don't even expect that they are being fooled and pooled by their nose themselves from the very beginning. Some might find this layer funny but I don't think of it as a joke. In fact, if the other layers are vague and hard to find true evidence, this one has proofs that I personally consider as truth.
And it is satan who allures these big people into thinking that money and power will grant them enjoyment and satisfaction. It won't. It's funny how people who consider themselves to be smartest strategists fall for the oldest trick of shaytan. Luring into dunya. Think about the face of Hitler when he realized that he lost the war. He might have thought what if I just was a simple worker who grew old and have kids and would spend summer evenings in the garden among tomatoes having dinner with the family. 
Maybe 🤔 it would be better than this.
There's a parking lot above former bunker of his in Berlin. It is a weird place to be when you know the history of it. Here's the photo.

If we generalize all people, we all fail to learn from history. How satan tricked Adam and Eve and he tricks us every day. You may consider this as a myth. Someday I had doubts too. And this is what the Quran says regarding the matter.
Tales of nations of the past.
