## 0. Before Creation of Humankind
***************************************

At first, there was only Allah.

<details>
	<summary>First Creations: Throne, The Pen and The Tablet</summary>

The first creation of Allah was the Throne (Al-'Arsh). It is considered to be the largest creation.
The Quran mentions the throne some 25 times (33 times as Al-'Arsh). 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, said: "Allah created the Throne as an indication of His power, not for taking it as a place for Himself."

‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Verily, the first to be created by Allah was the pen. 

Source: Sunan al-Tirmidhī 3319

Chapter 68 in the Quran is named ‘Al-Qalam’ (the pen). It opens up with the verse: ‘By the pen and what they inscribe.’

In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen; ‘Who taught by the pen. Taught mankind that which he knew not’ (96:4-5).

Allah told it to write, so the Pen wrote all that will happen until the Final Hour.

'Pen' isthe name of that thing by whose instrumentality Allah has caused the writing on the Tablet. Hence, Allah has ordained the Tablet to serve as an original record, through which the angels, peace be upon them, acquire the knowledge of what is going to happen concerning what is hidden and what is inspired.

Guarded (Preserved) Tablet
The Preserved Tablet is the record in which Allaah The Almighty has recorded the fate of His creatures before He created them. In this regard, He Says (what means): 
	
	"Do you not know that Allaah knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record." Quran 22: 70 

In his interpretation of this verse, Ibn ‘Atiyyah  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him said that the record in this verse refers to the Preserved Tablet. Allaah The Almighty also Says (what means): {No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a Record before We bring it into being.} [Quran 57: 22]  The Maaliki scholar, Al-Qurtubi  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him mentioned in his interpretation of this verse that the record mentioned here refers to the Preserved Tablet.

	<summary>Creation of Angels</summary>

Allah created angels from nur (luminous light).

One of the Islamic major characteristic is their lack of bodily desires; they never get tired, do not eat or drink, and have no anger.[9] As with other monotheistic religions, angels are characteristics of their purity and obedience to God. They have different roles, including their praise of God, interacting with humans in ordinary life, defending against devils and carrying on natural phenomena.[3] Islam acknowledges the concept of angels both as anthropomorphic creatures with wings and abstract forces advising good.[4] Belief in angels is one of the main articles of faith in Islam.

**Jibril** or the Ruh (Gabriel) is venerated as one of the primary archangels and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam.[60][61][62] Jibrīl is regarded as the archangel responsible for revealing the Quran to Muhammad, verse by verse;[60][61][62] he is primarily mentioned in the verses 2:97, 2:98, and 66:4 of the Quran, although the Quranic text doesn't explicitly refer to him as an angel.[61] Jibrīl is the angel who communicated with all of the prophets and also descended with the blessings of God during the night of Laylat al-Qadr ("The Night of Divine Destiny (Fate)"). Jibrīl is further acknowledged as a magnificent warrior in Islamic tradition, who led an army of angels into the Battle of Badr and fought against Iblis, when he tempted ʿĪsā (Jesus).[65] 

**Mikail** the archangel of mercy, is often depicted as providing nourishment for bodies and souls while also being responsible for bringing rain and thunder to Earth.[67] Some scholars pointed out that Mikail is in charge of angels who carry the laws of nature.

**Israfil** (frequently associated with the Jewish and Christian angel Raphael), is the archangel who blows into the trumpet in the end time, therefore also associated with music in some traditions.[69] Israfil is responsible for signaling the coming of Qiyamah (Judgment Day) by blowing a horn.

**Azrail**  is the archangel of death. He and his subordinative angels are responsible for parting the soul from the body of the dead and will carry the believers to heaven (Illiyin) and the unbelievers to hell (Sijjin).

Mentioned in Quran:
* Nāzi'āt and Nāshiṭāt, helpers of Azrail who take the souls of the deceased.
	* Nāzi'āt: they are responsible for taking out the souls of disbelievers painfully.
	* Nāshiṭāt: they are responsible for taking out the souls of believers peacefully.
* Hafaza, (The Guardian angel):
* Kiraman Katibin (Honourable Recorders), two of whom are charged to every human being; one writes down good deeds and another one writes down evil deeds. They are both described as 'Raqeebun 'Ateed' in the Qur'an.
* Mu'aqqibat (The Protectors) who keep people from death until its decreed time and who bring down blessings.
* Angels of Hell:
	* Maalik, Chief of the angels who govern Jahannam (Hell).
	* Nineteen angels of hell, commanding the Zabaniyya, to torment sinful people in hell.
	* Those angels who distribute provisions, rain, and other blessings by God's Command.
	* Those angels who drive the clouds.
	* Cherubim, who are close to God and request forgiveness for the sinners.
	* Hamalat al-'Arsh, those who carry the 'Arsh (Throne of God), comparable to the Christian Seraph.
	* Harut and Marut, often depicted as angels who taught the humans in Babylon magic; mentioned in Quran (2:102).

Also, there is a hadith about Munkar and Nakir, two angels questioning the dead.

	<summary>Creation of the Heavens and the Earth 🌌 🌍 </summary>

In the Quran, the heavens and the earth were joined together as one "unit of creation", after which they were "cloven asunder". After the parting of both, they simultaneously came into their present shape after going through a phase when they were smoke-like. The Quran states that the process of creation took 6 youm(يوم). In the Quran, the word youm (often translated to "era") means day.

The Qur'an says that `the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder` (21:30). Following this big explosion 💥, Allah ```turned to the sky, and it had been (as) smoke. He said to it and to the earth: 'Come together, willingly or unwillingly.' They said: 'We come (together) in willing obedience'``` (41:11). Thus the elements and what was to become the planets and stars began to cool, come together, and form into shape, following the natural laws that Allah established in the universe.

The Qur'an further states that Allah created the sun, the moon, and the planets, each with their own individual courses or orbits. "It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course" (21:33).

	"The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are expanding it" (51:47)

There has been some historical debate among Muslim scholars about the precise meaning of this verse, since knowledge of the universe's expansion was only recently discovered.

The Qur'an states that "Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six days" (7:54). While on the surface this might seem similar to the account related in the Bible, there are some important distinctions.

The verses that mention "six days" use the Arabic word "youm" (day). This word appears several other times in the Qur'an, each denoting a different measurement of time. In one case, the measure of a day is equated with 50,000 years (70:4), whereas another verse states that "a day in the sight of your Lord is like 1,000 years of your reckoning" (22:47). The word "youm" is thus understood, within the Qur'an, to be a long period of time -- an era or eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret the description of a "six day" creation as six distinct periods or eons. The length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period.

	<summary> Creatures Living on Earth</summary>

Allah created the Heavens and the Earth and all kinds of beasts. surah Lukman.
Creation of jinns from smokeless flame, the edge of the flame. 
After completing the Creation, the Qur'an describes that Allah "settled Himself upon the Throne" (57:4) to oversee His work.

After completing the Creation, the Qur'an describes that Allah "settled Himself upon the Throne" (57:4) to oversee His work. A distinct point is made to counter the Biblical idea of a day of rest: "We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us" (50:38).

Allah is never "done" with His work, because the process of creation is ongoing. Each new child who is born, every seed that sprouts into a sapling, every new species that appears on earth, is part of the ongoing process of Allah's creation. "He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters within the heart of the earth, and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven, and what mounts up to it. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah sees well all that you do" (57:4).

<summary>Era of Jinns</summary>

Allah created jinns from smokeless fire🔥. 

Jinns are the only creatures besides human that have a free will and they will be judged according to their deeds.
Jinns lived on the Earth and they could go beyond the Earth. Iblis was the best of jinn and he was allowed to be among the angels.

Jinns were transgressing and were not treating animals well.

Angels and Iblis were send to annihilate many jinnns who were transgressing.

There is a special type of jinns - shayatin. According to most sources, After Satan disobeyed Allah and vowed to lead humans astray, some jinns followed Satan, and they became shayatin, whose job is to lead people astray. and when a person is born, a shayatin is assigned to follow this person every day and whisper bad thoughts.

## 1. Adam and Eve 
*******************************************

<details> <summary> Adam was created from clay.</summary>

According to Quranic creation narrative, God informed the angels, that He was going to create a khalifa (vicegerent) on earth. 

While Islam recognizes the general idea of the development of life in stages, over a period of time, human beings are considered as a special act of creation. Islam teaches that human beings are a unique life form that was created by Allah in a special way, with unique gifts and abilities unlike any other: a soul and conscience, knowledge, and free will. In short, Muslims do not believe that human beings randomly evolved from apes. The life of human beings began with the creation of two people, a male and a female named Adam and Hawwa (Eve).
The Qur'an describes how Allah created Adam.

	"We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape..." 
	(Quran 15:26)
	
	"He began the creation of man from clay, and made his progeny from a quintessence of fluid"
	(Quran 32:7-8) 

While the creation of Eve is not described in detail, the Qur'an does make it clear that a "mate" was created with Adam, from the same nature and soul. "It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love" (7:189). She is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but in Islamic tradition she is known as "Hawwa" (Eve).

From these two individuals, generations of human beings have inhabited the earth. "Oh humankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, so that you may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honored among you in the sight of Allah is the who is the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things)" (49:13)

<details>
	<summary>Iblis refused to bow down to Adam</summary>

The Qur’an tells the story of Iblis several different times, each time offering different facets of the story. The version most relevant for our purposes, is in the seventh sura. God speaks first.

	We created you, We formed you; and then We commanded the angels, "bow down before Adam," and they bowed. But not Iblis; he refused to be one of those who bow.

	God said: "What prevented you from bowing down as I commanded you?" And he [Iblis] said: "I am better than he: You created me from fire and him from clay."

	God said: "Get down from here! Here is no place for your arrogance, Get out! You are the lowest of creatures!"
	but Iblis said, "Give me respite until the day they are raised."
	and God said, "You have respite."
	And then Iblis said, "Because you have put me in the wrong, I shall lie in wait for them on Your straight path; I will assault them from the front and the back, from their right and their left; nor will you find that most of them are grateful."
	God said, "Get out! You are disgraced and expelled! I swear I shall fill Hell with you and all who follow you."

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Creation of Hawwah (Eve)</summary>
Adam’s spouse, although commonly referred to as Eve or Hawa, is not mentioned by name in the Quran despite being referred to in many places. The details regarding how Eve was created is not mentioned in the Quran. However, it is made evident that Eve was created from Adam. 

	"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women…." Quran [4:1]

The hadith or traditions of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) further reveal that Eve was created from Adam’s rib which was taken while he was asleep. The narrations that describe this story of the rib is often used to emphasize being gentle and kind to women. 

“O Muslims! I advise you to be gentle with women, for they are created from a rib, and the most crooked portion of the rib is its upper part. If you try to straighten it, it will break, and if you leave it, it will remain crooked; so I urge you to take care of the women.” [Sahih al-Bukhari 5185; Sahih Muslim 8:3468]

After Eve was created, the couple was given a place in heaven.

	"And We said, ‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.’" Quran [2:35]

Eve was created to accompany Adam as his companion and life partner, and they were instructed to live together in tranquility. In heaven, Adam and Eve were free to eat and enjoy everything with the exception of one tree. 

The Quran does not describe what kind of tree it was, however, this prohibition set the stage for the test that was to come.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Adam and Eve: Eating from Forbidden Tree 🚻 🐍 🌳 🍎 </summary>

Adam and Hawwa disobeyed Allah and ate from the forbidden tree. They asked for forgiveness and Allah forgave them. and they were sent to live on the Earth.

In the Quran, the forbidden tree served as a test for Adam and Eve. Furthermore, God warned Adam and Eve that the devil was an enemy and that they should be on their guard. 

	"So We said, ‘O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer.’" Quran [20:117]

Satan, eagerly targeting the weakness of mankind, tempted Adam and Eve by whispering into their hearts. Claiming to be a sincere advisor, he planted in their minds ideas that would make the forbidden tree appealing. Thoughts of the tree preoccupied both Adam and Eve. Forgetting the warning, they gave in and erred.

	"But Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts. He said, ‘Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal.’ And he swore [by Allah ] to them, ‘Indeed, I am to you from among the sincere advisors.’ So he made them fall, through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called to them, ‘Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is to you a clear enemy?’" Quran [7:20-22]

By forgetting God’s command, Adam and Eve bore equal responsibility for their error. This too was a test for Satan, who in fact, furthered his disobedience by exploiting mankind through their desires. 
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Repentance of Adam and Eve and Allah's Forgiveness</summary>

Through this test, God prepared Adam for his role on earth, as a caretaker and a Prophet. This experience taught Adam firsthand that Satan was a deceptive enemy to mankind. 

After eating from the tree, Adam and Eve became ashamed and deeply regretted their actions. They acknowledged their errors and sought mercy, repenting sincerely [7:23].

The story of Adam and Eve in the Quran teaches the virtue of repentance and supplication. Adam and Eve recognized their errors and prayed for forgiveness. This, in turn, earned them Allah’s forgiveness and guidance.

"Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him]." Quran [20:122]

</details>


<details>
	<summary><b>Adam and Eve are sent to Earth</b>

They were forgiven but sent to Earth. They were forgiven but sent to Earth. They were forgiven but sent to Earth. They were forgiven but sent to Earth.
</summary>
In the Quran, God consoles Adam. Since the sin of Adam stemmed from desire, and not from arrogance, his repentance was accepted. 

“Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.” [2:37]

Despite being forgiven, Adam and Eve were no longer granted the comforts of paradise and would be sent to Earth. It is important to note that since Allah had mentioned Adam’s mission on Earth long before his test, Adam and Eve’s appointment to earth is not viewed as punishment, instead, it aligns with God’s Plan. The Quran describes the Earth to Adam and Eve as a place in which to reside and enjoy for a period of time, until the day they die and are resurrected (Quran 7:24-25). 

“We said, ‘Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance – there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs – those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.’” [2:38-39]

Furthermore, Adam is informed by God that he and his progeny will be sent guidance during their time on Earth. In contrast, Satan, unlike Adam, had not begged for forgiveness and had instead requested respite: a chance to mislead and reveal the inadequacy of mankind. God facilitated this request, but warned that Satan would be powerless over the believers. 

Therefore, in the Quran, Adam, Eve, and Satan are all sent down to Earth. On Earth, Adam (pbuh) assumes the role as the first Prophet and the father of mankind.

	<summary><b>Habyl and Qabyl</b></summary>

Adam and Eve had many children. Habyl and Qabyl (Abel and Cain), both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain. 27th verse of chapter 5 (sūrat l-māidah). 
According to the Quran and Bible, lifespan of some prophets was much longer than of modern people. They lived for up to one thousand years.
</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>Seth</b></summary>

Although the Quran makes no mention of Sheeth ibn Adam, he is revered within Islamic tradition as the third and righteous son of Adam and Eve and seen as the gift bestowed on Adam after the death of Abel.

The Islamic literature holds that Seth was born when Adam was past 100 and that Adam appointed Seth as guide to his people. The 11th-century Syrian historian and translator Al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik recorded the maxims and aphorisms of the ancient philosophers in his book Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim[16] and included a chapter on Seth. Within Islamic tradition Seth holds wisdom of several kinds; knowledge of time, prophecy of the future Great Flood, and inspiration on the methods of night prayer. Islam, Judaism and Christianity trace the genealogy of mankind back to Seth since Abel left no heirs and Cain's heirs, according to tradition, were destroyed by the Great Flood. Many traditional Islamic crafts are traced back to Seth, such as the making of horn combs

🎷 flute, music and dancing was invented. According to the Bible, Jubal the descendant of Cain invenved flute and music.
</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>Idris (Enoch)</b></summary>

Idris was born when Adam as was alive. Idris is mentioned in the Quran that he was of high class and a prophet. 
ibris was the first to write.

Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, where he is described as a wise man. In surah 19 of the Quran, Maryam, God says:

	"Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:
	And We raised him to a exalted place."
	Quran 19:56–57

	"And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Dhu al-Kifl,[19] all (men) of constancy and patience;
	We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones."
	Quran 21:85–86 (Yusuf Ali)

According to later Muslim writings, Idris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, God bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were not yet Muslims. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of the people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of his people left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.

They asked Prophet Idris: "If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?" Prophet Idris said: "If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us." So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: "SubhanAllah."

Islamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when Muhammad began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire. Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of God. Many early commentators, such as Tabari, credited Idris with possessing great wisdom and knowledge.

Exegesis narrates that Idris was among "the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures." These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the "prophet of the philosophers" and a number of works were attributed to him. Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works, all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.

The commentator Ibn Ishaq narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator Ibn Kathir narrated "During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, Ibn Abbas asked Ka’b what was meant by the part of the verse which says, ”And We raised him to a high station.” Ka’b explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‘I would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam’s children’ – perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‘Allah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.’ The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‘But where is Idris?’ He replied, ‘He is upon my back.’ The angel of death said: ‘How astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?’ Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‘And We raised him to a high station.’

Early accounts of Idris' life attributed "thirty portions of revealed scripture" to him. Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a messenger. Several modern commentators have linked this sentiment with Biblical apocrypha such as the Book of Enoch and the Second Book of Enoch.

#### How Idol Worshipping appeared

There was a time of righteous people. they lived in tawhid and five of them were most righteous and most popular: Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, Nasr. So people started celebrating anniversaries of these men. they made statues of these noble men to remind people of their piety and nobility, but some generations later, people started worshiping these statues.

## 3. Noah and the Great Flood ⛴ 🕊 ⛰ 
*************************************

Nuh is the second most narrated prophet in the Quran. he was the first prophet who was sent to people who were commiting shirk. 950 years he has been giving da'wah to his people, only about 10 to 80 people believed him.

<details>
	<summary><b>The Great Flood</b></summary>
According to Islam, he was a prophet, sent to warn mankind of that region and his people to change their ways. He conveyed the message for over 950 years. Islamic literature recounts that in the Generations of Adam, many men and women continued to follow Adam's original teachings, worshiping God alone and remaining righteous. Among Adam's descendants there were many brave and pious men, greatly loved and revered by their respective communities. Exegesis goes on to narrate that, upon the death of these elders, people felt enormous grief and some felt prompted to make statues of these people in remembrance of them. Then gradually, through the generations many forgot what such statues were for and began to worship them, (as the Shaytan (Satan) slowly deceived each generation) along with many other idols. In order to guide the people, God appointed Noah with the duty of being the next prophet to humanity.

Early preaching
According to Islamic belief, Noah began preaching to his people both verbally and by example. He would praise God consistently and he urged his people to do the same, warning his tribe of the punishment they would face if they did not mend their ignorant ways. The Qur'an states that Noah repeatedly told his people:

"O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day!"

Noah's ark depicted in a 14th-century manuscript of Rashid al-Din's world history, the Jami al-tawarikh
Early on, a few were moved by Noah's words but the powerful and wealthy members of the tribe refused to hear his call. The unbelievers at the time were impelled to rebel by various evil motives. Firstly, they were extremely envious and jealous of men superior to them in any way. Secondly, the people were ignorant of the weak and lowly, who were frequently superior intellectually, morally and spiritually. As a result of their ignorance, they were arrogant and mocked all who they felt were inferior to them. Saying "Are we to believe you, when those who follow you are the most abject of people?" Noah responded: "Their judgment rests only with my Lord, if you could perceive." When Noah preached the faith of God to them, all they did was revile the messenger, abuse the message and call the whole warning a lie. He then went on to explain the Message in greater depth, ensuring them that it was not a message of destruction but it was a message with the mercy from God, and that their acts would lead to destruction if they did not accept the faith. He questioned them, asking why they would not accept what would benefit them in the near future. Noah went onto further, and told his community that he asked of no reward from them, telling them his only reward would be from God. But his people threatened him with being stoned.

Accusation

Miniature from Hafiz-i Abru's Majma al-tawarikh. "Noah's Ark" Iran (Afghanistan), Herat; Timur’s son Shah Rukh (1405-1447) ordered the historian Hafiz-i Abru to write a continuation of the Jami al-tawarikh. Like the Il-Khanids, the Timurids were concerned with legitimizing their right to rule, and Hafiz-i Abru's "A Collection of Histories" covers a period that included the time of Shah Rukh himself.
As time passed, Noah became firmer in his preaching. When the unbelievers began insulting those who accepted God's message, believing that Noah would send those faithful away to attract the wealthy unbelievers, Noah revealed that they - the arrogant and ignorant rich - were the wicked and sinful ones. His people accused him of being soothsayer or diviner. Noah declared that he was by no means a mere fortune-teller, pretending to reveal secrets which are not worth revealing. Noah also denied accusations claiming he was an angel, always maintaining that he was a human messenger. When the people refused to acknowledge their sinfulness Noah told them that it was not Noah, but God that would punish them - however God pleased.

The Quran states that Noah prayed to God, telling him that his preaching only made his people disbelieve further. Noah told God how they had closed their minds to accepting the message, so that the light of the truth should not affect their thinking. Noah told God how he had used all the resources of the classical preacher, conveying the message both in public places and with individuals in private. Noah spoke of how he had told the people the rewards they would receive if they became righteous, namely that God would supply plentiful rain as a blessing, and that God would also guarantee them an increase in children and wealth.

Building of the Ark

Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh
According to the Quran, one day, Noah received a revelation from God, in which he was told that no one would believe the message now aside from those who have already submitted to God. Noah's frustration at the defiance of his people led him to ask God to not leave even one sinner upon earth.[29] Although there is no proof that God accepted his prayer (as there is many examples of accepted prayers, such as in case of Yunus, Lut (Lot), Suleyman (Solomon) etc., even Noah's prayer in some other shape was accepted), God decreed that a terrible flood would come (and yet, Qur'an doesn't say it came to cover whole Earth) and He ordered Noah to build a ship (Fulk) which would save him and the believers from this dreadful calamity.[41] Ever obedient to God's instructions, Noah went out in search of material with which to build the vessel. When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed at him even more than before. Their conclusion was that he was surely a madman – they could not find any other reason why a man would build a huge vessel when no sea or river was nearby.[29] Although Noah was now very old, the aged patriarch continued to work tirelessly until, at last, the Ship was finished.

Family
Little is known of Noah's personal history before his call to prophecy. However, Ibn Kathir records him to have been the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah, one of the patriarchs from the Generations of Adam. Noah was neither the leader of the tribe nor a very rich man but, even before being called to prophecy, he worshiped God faithfully and was, in the words of the Qur'an, "a devotee most grateful".

Noah was married to a woman whose name is not mentioned in the Quran. Some Islamic historians such as Al-Tabari have suggested that the name of Noah's wife was Umzarah bint Barakil but this cannot be confirmed. Most Muslims simply call her by her midrashic name Naamah.[citation needed] Islamic scholars agree that Noah had four sons whose names were Ham, Shem, Yam and Japheth. According to the Quran, one of Noah's sons was a disbeliever who refused to come aboard the Ark, instead preferring to climb a mountain, where he drowned. It is agreed among most Islamic scholars that Yam was the one who drowned; the other three remained believers.

The Quran states that Noah's wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him; neither did one of Noah's sons (Yam), who was secretly a disbeliever but had pretended faith in front of Noah. The sons of Noah are not expressly mentioned in the Qur'an, except for the fact that one of the sons was among the people who did not follow his own father, not among the believers and thus was washed away in the flood.[44] Also the Qur'an indicates a great calamity, enough to have destroyed Noah's people, but to have saved him and his generations to come. Noah's wife (Naamah) is referred to in the Qur'an as an evil woman. When God emphasizes upon the notion that everyone is for themselves on the Day of Judgement and that marital relations will not be to your aid when the judgement takes place.

In contrast, the wife of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Asiya, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are referred to as among the best of women. This adds to the notion that, on the Last Day, everyone will be judged according to their own deeds. The "Stories of The Prophets" explain that the son who declined to embark was a non-believer.
After the flood, people started over and for some time they lived in tawhid.

#### Saleh and people of Thamud 🐪
(Selah?)

Thamud were a tribal confederation in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mentioned in Assyrian sources in the time of Sargon II. The tribe's name continues to appear in documents into the fourth century CE, but by the sixth century they were regarded as a group that had vanished long ago.
<details>
<summary><b>Open history of Thamud </b></summary>
<p>
According to the Quran, the city that Saleh was sent to was called al-Hijr, which corresponds to the Nabataean city of Hegra. The city rose to prominence around the first century AD as an important site in the regional caravan trade. Adjacent to the city were large, decorated rock-cut tombs used by members of various religious groups.
</p><p>
Saleh's life in his community had been so righteous that the people of Thamud virtually relied upon him for support. He was chosen by God as a Messenger and sent to preach against the selfishness of the wealthy and to condemn the practice of Shirk (Idolatry or Polytheism). Although Saleh preached the message for a sustained period of time, the people for Thamud refused to hear his warning and instead began to ask Saleh to perform a miracle for them. They said: "O Salih! Thou hast been of us! A centre of our hopes hitherto! Dost thou forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshiped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us."
</p><p>
Saleh reminded his people of the countless castles and palaces they built out of stone, and of their technological superiority over neighboring communities. Furthermore, he told them about their ancestors, the ʿĀd tribe, and how they too were destroyed for their sins. Some of the people of Thamud believed Saleh's words, but the tribal leaders refused to listen to him and continued to demand that he demonstrate a miracle to prove his prophethood.
</p><p>
In response, God gave the Thamud a blessed she-camel, as both a means of sustenance and a test. The tribe was told to allow the camel to graze peacefully and avoid harming her. But in defiance of Saleh's warning, the people of the tribe hamstrung the camel. Saleh informed them that they had only three more days to live before the wrath of God descended upon them. The people of the city were remorseful, but their crime could not be undone, and all the disbelieving people in the city were killed in an earthquake. Al-Hijr was rendered uninhabited and remained in ruins for all time thereafter. Saleh himself and the few believers who followed him survived.
</p><p>
The story is expanded upon in Sūrat an-Naml, whilst the she-camel is not mentioned explicitly here, it states that nine men plotted to kill Salih and his whole family, a crime for which they were struck down by God 3 days later.

## 4. Ibrahim
*******************************************

**Ibrahim**: Ibrahim is from Iraq, Hagar is from Egypt. Hajj was established by Ibrahim. Kurban was established by the example of Ibrahim and his son. Ibrahim had two sons Iskhak and Ishmael. Iskhak became the father of Jewish people. Ismail helped Ibrahim to build the Kaaba and became the father of Arab people.

There is no agreed opinion on how many generations passed from Adam till Nuh, from Nuh till Ibrahim. The jewish sources clain that the humanity lived only 6000 years but Muslims don't have this fixed timeline, we can extrapolate. there is scientific evidence that Homo-Sapiens existed for ...
and the prophet Muhammad saw said that the distance between me and Al Kiyamah is like distance between my two fingers.

<details>
	<summary>Early Life</summary>

Ibrahim was born in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called 'Ur' in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion.

His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ebrahem would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always scold him for not following his ancestors' rituals and mocking their idols.

When Ibrahim was young he used to laugh whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.

One night, Abraham went up to the mountain, leaned against a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, "Could this be my Lord?" But when it set he said: "I don't like those that set." The star had disappeared so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, "Could this be my Lord?" but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" But when the sun also set he said, "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." After this declaration, Abraham then heard Allah calling him, "O Abraham " Abraham trembled and said, "Here I am O my Lord!" Allah replied, "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!"Abraham fell to the ground, crying. He said: "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" Abraham kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.

	<summary>Ayyub (Job)</summary>

Ayyub came after Yusuf. The Quran describes Job as a righteous servant of Allah, who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Job never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer, asking Him to remove his affliction:
And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful." — Quran, sura 21 (The Prophets), ayah 83

The narrative goes on to state that after many years of suffering, God ordered Job to "Strike with thy foot!".[6] At once, Job struck the ground with his foot and God caused a cool spring of water to gush forth from the Earth, from which Job could replenish himself. The Quran states that it was then that God removed his pain and suffering and He returned Job's family to him, blessed him with many generations of children and granted him great wealth. In addition to the brief descriptions of Job's narrative, the Quran further mentions Job twice in the lists of those whom God had given special guidance, wisdom and inspiration (IV: 163) and as one of the men who received authority, the gift of prophethood (VI:84).

After Satan has given up trying to turn Job away from the Lord, God removed Job's affliction and returned his family to him, doubling them in number. He returned Job's wealth and showered Job with gold. Once Job's wife had seen her husband restored to prosperity and health, she prayed thanks to God but then worried over the oath her husband had taken earlier, in which he had promised to beat her with a hundred strokes. Job was also deeply grieved over the oath he had taken, amidst his suffering. God, however, sent a revelation to Job, which told him to not beat his wife but to gently hit her with a bundle of soft grass.

	<summary>Shu'ayb (Jethro?)</summary>

The Qur'an states that Shuaib was appointed by God to be a prophet to the people of Midian. The people of this land were said to be especially notorious for cheating others through dishonesty and for idolatry. Shuʿayb's prophecy mainly involved calling the Midianites to the correct path of God, and forbidding them to worship false gods.

It is also said he told his people to stop being dishonest in their daily activities. Although he preached and prophesied for a sustained period of time, the majority of the people refused to listen to him. Shuayb, however, remained steadfast. He consistently preached powerfully against the wicked, telling them of the punishment that had befallen the sinful before them. Shuʿayb warned the people that their ignorance would lead to the destruction of Midian, giving historical examples of earlier prophets, including Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot, all of whose people had been destroyed by God.

The people taunted Shuʿayb and told him that, were it not for the prestigious family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuayb replied, "Is my family of more consideration with you than God?" When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur'an, however, mentions that Shuʿayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment.

<details>
<summary><b>Sulayman (Solomon) </b></summary>
Sulaimān ibn Dāwūd (Arabic: سُلَيْمَان بْن دَاوُوْد, Solomon son of David) was, according to the Quran, a malik (مَلِك, king) and Nabī (Prophet) of the Israelites. Islamic tradition generally holds that he was the third king of Jewish people, and a wise ruler for the nation.

Islam views Solomon as one of the prophets of God, who was bestowed with many God-given gifts, including the ability to speak to animals and jinn. Supported by a magical ring given by God, he enslaved the devils (shayatin) and demons (div).

Muslims further maintain that he remained faithful to the one and only God throughout his life; and reigned justly over the whole of the Israelites; was blessed with a level of kingship which was given to none after him and before him; and fulfilled all of his commandments, being promised nearness to God in Paradise at the end of his life. Arab historians regarded Solomon as one of the greatest rulers around the world.

**Judgment on the field**

In the earliest narrative involving Solomon, the Quran (21:78) briefly alludes to a story that Solomon was in the company of his father, when two men came to ask David to judge between them regarding a ḥarth (حَرْث, field). Later Muslim commentators expanded on the allusion, including Al-Tabari, Baidawi, and Ibn Kathir. They said that the first of the two men said that he owned a vineyard of which he took great care the whole year through. But one day, when he was absent, the other man's sheep had strayed into the vineyard and devoured the grapes. He asked to be compensated for this damage.[9]: 62  Upon hearing the man's complaint, Solomon suggested that the owner of the sheep take the other man's vineyard to repair and cultivate until the vines returned to their former state, whereupon he should return it to its owner. At the same time, the owner of the vineyard would care for the sheep and benefit from their wool and milk until his land was returned to him, at which point he would return the sheep to their owner. Solomon's level of judgment, which the Quran says,[10] would characterize Solomon throughout his life. Ḥikmah (Wisdom), according to Muslim tradition, would always be associated with Solomon, who would later even be referred to as Sulaimān al-Ḥakīm (سُلَيْمَان ٱلْحَكِيْم, "Solomon the Wise"). This story is adapted in the Kebra Nagast, but as a dispute adjudicated by a son of Solomon's.

**Solomon and the demons**

The Queen of Sheba
The Quran narrates that the wind was made subservient to Solomon, and he could control it at his own will, and that the jinn also came under Solomon's control. The jinn helped strengthen Solomon's reign. The devils (shayatin), and demons were forced building for him monuments. God also caused a miraculous ʿayn (عَيْن, 'fount' or 'spring') of molten qiṭr (قِطْر, 'brass' or 'copper') to flow for Solomon, to be used by the demons in their construction.

When David died, Solomon inherited his position as the prophetic king of the Israelites. Solomon once permitted a woman to build a statue of her father. Later, she began to worship the statue and Solomon was rebuked for tolerating idolatry in his kingdom. As a punishment, God enabled one of the enslaved demons to steal Solomon's ring and take over his kingdom (Surah 38:34). He later repents his sin and gains control over the demons again, focusing on building the temple again. He prayed to God to grant him a kingdom which would be unlike any after him. God accepted Solomon's prayer and gave him what he pleased.

Allegorical, Solomon's loss to the demons, is a human losing its soul to demonic passion. Attar of Nishapur writes: "If you bind the div (demon), you will set out for the royal pavilion with Solomon" and "You have no command over your self's kingdom, for in your case the div is in the place of Solomon".

Unlike the Talmudic tradition, Solomon was unaware and never participated in idolatry. Further, the Quran rejects that Solomon was a magician: "(...) Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching men magic and (...)". (2:102)

**Solomon and the ant** 🐜

Solomon was even taught the languages of various animals, such as ants. The Quran recounts that, one day, Solomon and his army entered a wādin-naml (وَادِ ٱلْنَّمْل, valley of the ant). On seeing Solomon and his army, a namlah (نَمْلَة, female ant) warned all the others to `... get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it.` Immediately understanding what the ant said, Solomon, as always, prayed to God, thanking him for bestowing upon him such gifts and further avoided trampling over the ant colonies.[9]: 63 Solomon's wisdom, however, was yet another of the gifts he received from God, and Muslims maintain that Solomon never forgot his daily prayer, which was more important to him than any of his gifts.

Exegetical literature emphasizes the ant's wisdom and explains the meaning behind Solomon's gift to control the wind. According to Siracü'l-Kulub, the ant asks Solomon if he knows why he is called "Solomon" (Süleyman). Solomon negates and the ant went on to explain: "Although your heart was sound (selim) and you know the circumstances of the next world, you have accepted a few pleassures of this world and have been deceived by its possesion and kingship; therefore you are called Solomon." Afterwards the ant asks Solomon, if he knows why God has subdued the wind for him. Once again, Solomon denies and the ant answers: "He has subdued the wind for a reason: that which you have accepted is nothing. Just as the wind passes, the world's wealth and kingship pass too." Scholars like Fakhr al-Din Razi and al-Qurtubi elevated the ant to the rank of an examplar for humans to follow.(p196)

**Conquest of Saba'**

Ruins of the Barran Temple at Ma'rib, the former capital of Saba' in what is now Yemen
Another important aspect of Solomon's kingship was the size of his army, which consisted of both men and jinn. Solomon would frequently assess his troops and warriors as well as the jinn and all the animals who worked under him. One day, when inspecting his troops, Solomon found the Hud-hud (هُدْهُد, Hoopoe) missing from the assembly. Shortly later, however, the Hud-hud arrived to Solomon's court, saying "I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba' with tidings true."The Hud-hud further told Solomon that the people of Sheba worshiped the Sun, and that the woman who ruled the kingdom was highly intelligent and powerful. Solomon, who listened closely, chose to write a letter to the land of Sheba, through which he would try to convince the people of Sheba to cease in worshiping the Sun, and to come to the worship of God. Solomon ordered the Hud-hud to give the letter to the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis), and then to hide and observe her reaction.[9]: 64  The Hud-hud accepted Solomon's orders, and flew to give the letter to her. The Queen then called her ministers in the court and announced the letter of Solomon stating to the people of Sheba: "In the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful, Be you not exalted against me, but come to me as Muslimīn (مُسْلِمِيْن)." She asked for suggestions from her minister and administration stating that "O my people, I know that you all are powerful and brave warriors, and no one on the face of the Earth can defeat our army, but still I want your opinion." The people of the court replied: "You have all the power, and whatever order you deliver, you will find us obedient." Eventually, however, the Queen came to Solomon, announcing her submission to God.

**Solomon and the ifrit**

During Bilqis' travel, Solomon asks his servants to deliver her throne to his court. An ifrit offers his service (Q27:38-40), but Solomon declines. Another man is endowed with this task instead, who prays to God for the throne. Afterwards, the prayer is answered and the throne appears thanks to God's power in Solomon's palace. When Bilqis arrives, Solomon asks if she can recognize her throne. She gives him an evasive answer, because she can not grasp the miracle performed here. Since this miracle was done by God (and not by the ifrit), she surrenders to the faith of Solomon. Solomon declined the ifrit's temptatious offer, because he wants to rely on God only and not on the demonic, this leading to his successful conversation of Bilqis.

**Death**

The Quran relates that Solomon died while he was leaning on his staff. Then a creature (an ant or a worm) gnaw at Solomon's staff, until his body collapsed.

	Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the Jinn saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty (of their Task).
	Qurʾan, Surah 34 (Sabaʾ), Ayah 14

As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them.

They realized the truth only when God sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon's staff, until his body collapsed. This verse is understood to teach the audience that jinn do not know the unseen (Al-Ghaib), since if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the service of Solomon.[28]

After introducing idols, Jews ceased to visit the temple of Abraham. Jurhumites from Yemen were rulers of Mecca for some time. They started committing injustice and were finally driven out. Before going, they buried Zamzam in the sand. A chieftan from Kuza'ah when coming back from Syria asked the Moabites(or the giants tribe) to give him one of their idols. They gave him Hubal, which he brought back to sanctuary, setting it up within the Ka'bah itself; and it became the chief idol of Mecca.

Kinanah he was known for his bravery and wisdom. People would do hajj to meet Kinanah. 3 people have a founding role in founding Quraish. 

WHen Khuzagha attacked Jurhum, Jurhum hid the Zamzam before they leave.

At that time, Khuzagha was controlling Mecca. he married chieftan's daughter and after the chieftan died, people wanted Qusayy to take over so he united Quraish tribes and fought against sons of Khuzagha chieftan and reclaimed the control over Mecca for the Quraish.

The great-great-greatfather of the Prophet Muhammad saw. after battles it was agreed that Qusay from Quraish must be the guardian of the Kaaba. They were receiving taxes, feeding the pilgrims and living in tents. Qusayy told them to build houses. His hidden qualities enabled him to establish his superiority over the Makkans and especially the tribe of Quraysh. Within a short time he acquired the high governmental offices in Makkah and also became the custodian of the keys of the Ka'bah and the undisputed ruler of that city.

Many remarkable events are associated with his name. One of these was that he encouraged the people to construct a house with the name of 'Darun Nadwah' adjacent to the Ka'bah and thus founded a Council Hall for the Arabs so that their dignitaries and chiefs might sit together in this public centre and solve their problems. He died in the 5th A.D. and left behind two sons named Abdud Dar and Abd Manaf.

#### 10 Major Signs of Al Kiyamah

These signs are connected to each other. When one comes, the other one follows.
There is a hadith that prophet Muhammad saw said, If you encounter the beginning of Al Kiyamah while planting a palm seed, continue planting the seed.

<details>
	<summary><b>Dajjal - the false Messiah or Anti-Christ</b></summary> 

</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>Gog and Magog (Yadjuj and Madjuj)</b></summary> 

</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>3 sinkings (swallowings) of the earth</b></summary> 
(maybe major earthquakes). One in the east, one in the west and one in Arabia.
</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>A fire would come out of Yemen</b></summary> 

</details>

<details>
	<summary><b>Isa will return to the Earth and defeat Dajjal</b></summary> 

Isa will die in Medina. and later Medina would be destroyed. no Muslims will be left there.
The Quran will be lifted up.
 Later there will be a ruler from Abyssinia, who will destroy the Kaaba.
while believers would march to figt the Abyssinain ruler, Allah will send a light breeze that will take away the souls of all believers. and only unbelievers will be left on the Earth and they will live like animals.

everything in ad-dunya is cursed except the remembrance of Allah and whoever are the allies of the remembrance of Allah.

<details>
	<summary><b>The Smoke (Ad-Dukhan)</b></summary> 
The Day of Judgement will not take place until you experience Ad Dukhaw. a smoke that will appear in the sky. you will see it, you will feel it. some hadiths say "dark smoke". it will come into everyone. Smoke will come upon the believers like a flu or cold. and it will come upon non-believers causing disaster death, severe ilness and loding consciousness.

The Smoke is mentioned in the Quran.

	"Then wait for the Day when the sky will bring a visible smoke, covering the people; this is a painful torment. [They will say], “Our Lord, remove from us the torment; indeed, we are believers.” How can they be reminded when a messenger has already come to them, making things clear."
	Quran surah Ad Dukhan

🌌
Humans are created between angels and animals. Angels dont have their own desires they only worship Allah. and animals are living on their instincts and dont worship Allah as the angels so.
and if human beings incline to instincts, they become worse than animals. and if they incline towards worshipping Allah, they become better than angels.
Adam was the last of Allah's creations.


about 70 years ago there was a consensus in the scientific world that the universe is eternal, which contradicts the Quran that says Allah started the universe. and after 20 years more cosmic data came and scientists accepted that the Big Bang Theory make more sense. 

Arab people didn't even count the years. the calendar was adopted only during the reign of khalif Umar ibn Al Khattab.
