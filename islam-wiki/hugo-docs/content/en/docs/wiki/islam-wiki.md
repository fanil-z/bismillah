## 0. Before Creation of Humankind
***************************************

At first, there was only Allah.

<details>
	<summary>First Creations: Throne, The Pen and The Tablet</summary>

The first creation of Allah was the Throne (Al-'Arsh). It is considered to be the largest creation.
The Quran mentions the throne some 25 times (33 times as Al-'Arsh). 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, said: "Allah created the Throne as an indication of His power, not for taking it as a place for Himself."

‚ÄòUbadah ibn al-Samit reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ‚ÄúVerily, the first to be created by Allah was the pen. 

Source: Sunan al-TirmidhiÃÑ 3319

Chapter 68 in the Quran is named ‚ÄòAl-Qalam‚Äô (the pen). It opens up with the verse: ‚ÄòBy the pen and what they inscribe.‚Äô

In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen; ‚ÄòWho taught by the pen. Taught mankind that which he knew not‚Äô (96:4-5).

Allah told it to write, so the Pen wrote all that will happen until the Final Hour.

'Pen' isthe name of that thing by whose instrumentality Allah has caused the writing on the Tablet. Hence, Allah has ordained the Tablet to serve as an original record, through which the angels, peace be upon them, acquire the knowledge of what is going to happen concerning what is hidden and what is inspired.

Guarded (Preserved) Tablet
The Preserved Tablet is the record in which Allaah The Almighty has recorded the fate of His creatures before He created them. In this regard, He Says (what means): 
	
	"Do you not know that Allaah knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record." Quran 22: 70 

In his interpretation of this verse, Ibn ‚ÄòAtiyyah  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him said that the record in this verse refers to the Preserved Tablet. Allaah The Almighty also Says (what means): {No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a Record before We bring it into being.} [Quran 57: 22]  The Maaliki scholar, Al-Qurtubi  may  Allaah  have  mercy  upon  him mentioned in his interpretation of this verse that the record mentioned here refers to the Preserved Tablet.

	<summary>Creation of Angels</summary>

Allah created angels from nur (luminous light).

One of the Islamic major characteristic is their lack of bodily desires; they never get tired, do not eat or drink, and have no anger. As with other monotheistic religions, angels are characteristics of their purity and obedience to God. They have different roles, including their praise of God, interacting with humans in ordinary life, defending against devils and carrying on natural phenomena. Islam acknowledges the concept of angels both as anthropomorphic creatures with wings and abstract forces advising good. Belief in angels is one of the main articles of faith in Islam.

**Jibril** or the Ruh (Gabriel) is venerated as one of the primary archangels and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam. Jibrƒ´l is regarded as the archangel responsible for revealing the Quran to Muhammad, verse by verse; he is primarily mentioned in the verses 2:97, 2:98, and 66:4 of the Quran, although the Quranic text doesn't explicitly refer to him as an angel. Jibrƒ´l is the angel who communicated with all of the prophets and also descended with the blessings of God during the night of Laylat al-Qadr ("The Night of Divine Destiny (Fate)"). Jibrƒ´l is further acknowledged as a magnificent warrior in Islamic tradition, who led an army of angels into the Battle of Badr and fought against Iblis, when he tempted  øƒ™sƒÅ (Jesus).

Daniel saw Gabriel

Ezekiel saw Gabriel

Gabriel came to Zakariyah and tells him that his prayers are heard and that they his wife will give birth to John.

Jibril came to Maryam and told the good news that she will give birth to a child Jesus.

Jibril had special relation with the prophet Muhammed (sww). In most cases he used to come to the prophet in a human form and give a Revelation or explain religious and worldly matters. Documented occasions when Jibril communicated with the prophet Muhammad:
1. There is an authentic hadith that when the prophet Muhammad was 4-6 years old, Jibril came to him opened up his chest and cleaned his heart in Zamzam water.
2. Close to the prophecy times, the prophet Muhammad starts to see a man in a dream who later turns out to be Jibril. 
3. In the cave of the mount Hira, Jibril comes to the prophet Muhammad and says "Iqra!" ("Recite!"). After the prophet says that he does not know what to recite, Jibril huggs him tight and transfers the first surah of the Quran. the prophet Muhammad was so overwhelmed by this experience, that he hurries back home and asks Hadija to cover him with cloth.

**Mikail** the archangel of mercy, is often depicted as providing nourishment for bodies and souls while also being responsible for bringing rain and thunder to Earth. Some scholars pointed out that Mikail is in charge of angels who carry the laws of nature.

**Israfil** (frequently associated with the Jewish and Christian angel Raphael), is the archangel who blows into the trumpet in the end time, therefore also associated with music in some traditions. Israfil is responsible for signaling the coming of Qiyamah (Judgment Day) by blowing a horn.

**Azrail**  is the archangel of death. He and his subordinative angels are responsible for parting the soul from the body of the dead and will carry the believers to heaven (Illiyin) and the unbelievers to hell (Sijjin).

Mentioned in Quran:
* NƒÅzi'ƒÅt and NƒÅshi·π≠ƒÅt, helpers of Azrail who take the souls of the deceased.
	* NƒÅzi'ƒÅt: they are responsible for taking out the souls of disbelievers painfully.
	* NƒÅshi·π≠ƒÅt: they are responsible for taking out the souls of believers peacefully.
* Hafaza, (The Guardian angel):
* Kiraman Katibin (Honourable Recorders), two of whom are charged to every human being; one writes down good deeds and another one writes down evil deeds. They are both described as 'Raqeebun 'Ateed' in the Qur'an.
* Mu'aqqibat (The Protectors) who keep people from death until its decreed time and who bring down blessings.
* Angels of Hell:
	* Maalik, Chief of the angels who govern Jahannam (Hell).
	* Nineteen angels of hell, commanding the Zabaniyya, to torment sinful people in hell.
	* Those angels who distribute provisions, rain, and other blessings by God's Command.
	* Those angels who drive the clouds.
	* Cherubim, who are close to God and request forgiveness for the sinners.
	* Hamalat al-'Arsh, those who carry the 'Arsh (Throne of God), comparable to the Christian Seraph.
	* Harut and Marut, often depicted as angels who taught the humans in Babylon magic; mentioned in Quran (2:102).

Also, there is a hadith about Munkar and Nakir, two angels questioning the dead.

	<summary>Creation of the Heavens and the Earth üåç </summary>

In the Quran, the heavens and the earth were joined together as one "unit of creation", after which they were "cloven asunder". After the parting of both, they simultaneously came into their present shape after going through a phase when they were smoke-like. The Quran states that the process of creation took 6 youm(ŸäŸàŸÖ). In the Quran, the word youm (often translated to "era") means day.

The Qur'an says that `the heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder` (21:30). Following this big explosion üí•, Allah ```turned to the sky, and it had been (as) smoke. He said to it and to the earth: 'Come together, willingly or unwillingly.' They said: 'We come (together) in willing obedience'``` (41:11). Thus the elements and what was to become the planets and stars began to cool, come together, and form into shape, following the natural laws that Allah established in the universe.

The Qur'an further states that Allah created the sun, the moon, and the planets, each with their own individual courses or orbits. "It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course" (21:33).

	"The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are expanding it" (51:47)

There has been some historical debate among Muslim scholars about the precise meaning of this verse, since knowledge of the universe's expansion was only recently discovered.

The Qur'an states that "Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six days" (7:54). While on the surface this might seem similar to the account related in the Bible, there are some important distinctions.

The verses that mention "six days" use the Arabic word "youm" (day). This word appears several other times in the Qur'an, each denoting a different measurement of time. In one case, the measure of a day is equated with 50,000 years (70:4), whereas another verse states that "a day in the sight of your Lord is like 1,000 years of your reckoning" (22:47). The word "youm" is thus understood, within the Qur'an, to be a long period of time -- an era or eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret the description of a "six day" creation as six distinct periods or eons. The length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period.

	<summary> Creatures Living on Earth</summary>

Allah created the Heavens and the Earth and all kinds of beasts. surah Lukman.
Creation of jinns from smokeless flame, the edge of the flame. 
After completing the Creation, the Qur'an describes that Allah "settled Himself upon the Throne" (57:4) to oversee His work.

After completing the Creation, the Qur'an describes that Allah "settled Himself upon the Throne" (57:4) to oversee His work. A distinct point is made to counter the Biblical idea of a day of rest: "We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us" (50:38).

Allah is never "done" with His work, because the process of creation is ongoing. Each new child who is born, every seed that sprouts into a sapling, every new species that appears on earth, is part of the ongoing process of Allah's creation. "He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters within the heart of the earth, and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven, and what mounts up to it. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah sees well all that you do" (57:4).

<details>
<summary>Era of Jinns</summary>

Allah created jinns from smokeless fireüî•. 

Jinns are the only creatures besides human that have a free will and they will be judged according to their deeds.
Jinns lived on the Earth and they could go beyond the Earth. Iblis was the best of jinn and he was allowed to be among the angels.
The term jin occurs thirty nine times in the Qur‚Äôan. There is a whole sura called sura al-Jinn, which speaks clearly and
explicitly about the jinn. They are a part of divine creation separate from humanity and the angels, but they share certain
qualities with mankind, like intellect, discrimination and the capacity for freedom (Leaman, 2006).
In the Qur‚Äôan, Allah mentions the word jin as jan,
1 jinnah,
2 and jin.
3 The word of al-jan shows in plural meaning and
indicates as a creature that is hidden from the insights, as mentioned in sura al-Hijr verse 27. This verse explains the jinn
were created before the creation of mankind, and their origin is from smokeless fire. This fire was taken from the clean,
pure, extremely hot and the most excellent (Ibn Kathir, 1999; al-Alusi, n.d)

Most of exegetes said Jann was the father of jinn as Adam was father to the mankind (Al-Razi, 1981). The jinn live
in a world that cannot be seen with the senses. According to most of scholars, they eat, drink and procreate. Similar to
humans, some are righteous while others are not.

In addition, the Qur‚Äôan also mentions Ifrit in sura al-Naml (The Ant) verse 39 and khannas in sura al-Nas (The
Mankind) verse 4 which both mean the jinn. Moreover, the exegetes noted the Qur‚Äôan has given a description and
explanation about the jinn and their social condition. Al-Tabari (2001) for example in his commentary explains that human
and jinn were created as creatures who have the obligation to surrender and worship God as the creator. Allah mentioned
in sura al-Dhariyat (The Winnowing Winds) verse 56 that indicates the existence of the jinn which means:
And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.
According to the majority of scholars the jinn are being obliged to follow the Islamic law that was revealed by Allah
to His Messenger Muhammad (Al-Shibli, 1985). They are obliged as well as human in obeying of all commands and avoid
the prohibitions (Bali, 1998, Al-Ashqar, 1999), as described in sura al-Rahman (The Beneficient) verse 13:
So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
According to al-Razi (1981) in his exegetical work the discussion appearing in this verse is addressed to the jinn
and mankind. It means that the jinn are obliged to act in accordance with Allah‚Äôs orders and to perform worshipping like
humans.
From here, the jinn conditions as human beings, among them have accepted the revelation of the Prophet
Muhammad (pbuh). They are part of the divine creation and have attitudes, namely intellect, ability to be free and
independent. They have the power to choose between true and false, right and wrong as Allah said in sura al-Jinn
verse11 below:
And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways. 

According to Arabic linguists there are different categories of jinn: (i) jinni, in general terms. (ii) Amir or dweller if the
jinn lives in houses with people (iii) Arwah or spirits who interact with children. (iv) Shaytan or Satan if the jinn is wicked.
(v) if he is worse than that, called marid or demon. (vi) Ifrit, if he is worse than that and strong (al-Shibli, 1985). In general,
the pagan believe that jinn have hidden powers, giving some benefit and harassment. As Allah says in Sura Saba‚Äô verse
41:
They will say, ‚ÄúExalted are You! You, [O Allah], are our benefactor not them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most
of them were believers in them.‚Äù
Similarly in Sura al-Jinn verse 6, Allah explains that most pagan seek help and protection to jinn. In view of them
there is collaboration between man and poets of jinn which they can produce beautiful poetry to listen to (Shihab, 2002)

Jinns were transgressing and were not treating animals well.

Angels and Iblis were send to annihilate many jinnns who were transgressing.

There is a special type of jinns - shayatin (devils). According to most sources, After Satan disobeyed Allah and vowed to lead humans astray, some jinns followed Satan, and they became shayatin, whose job is to lead people astray. and when a person is born, a shayatin is assigned to follow this person every day and whisper bad thoughts.

The community of the jinn race were like those of humans, but then corruption and injustice among them increased and all warnings sent by God were ignored. Consequently, God sent his angels to battle the infidel jinn. Just a few survived, and were ousted to far islands or to the mountains. With the revelation of Islam, the jinn were given a new chance to access salvation.[25][41][42] However, because of their prior creation, the jinn would attribute themselves to a superiority over humans and envy them for their place and rank on earth.

Jinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the Quran. In Islamic tradition, Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and that prophets and messengers were sent to both communities. Traditionally, the 72nd surah, Al-Jinn, named after them, is held to tell about the revelation to jinn and several stories mention one of Muhammad's followers accompanied him, witnessing the revelation to the jinn.

In the story of Solomon they appear as nature spirits comparable to Talmudic shedim.Solomon was gifted by God to talk to animals and spirits. God granted him authority over the rebellious jinn and devils forcing them to build the First Temple. In other instances, the Quran tells about Pagan Arabs, calling jinn for help, instead of God. The Quran reduced the status of jinn from that of tutelary deities to that of minor spirits, usually paralleling humans.

the Jinn were allowed to enter heavens to listen to angels. That stopeed when the Iqra came.

## 1. Adam and Eve 
*******************************************

<details> <summary> Adam was created from clay.</summary>

According to Quranic creation narrative, God informed the angels, that He was going to create a khalifa (vicegerent) on earth. 
  
While Islam recognizes the general idea of the development of life in stages, over a period of time, human beings are considered as a special act of creation. Islam teaches that human beings are a unique life form that was created by Allah in a special way, with unique gifts and abilities unlike any other: a soul and conscience, knowledge, and free will. In short, Muslims do not believe that human beings randomly evolved from apes. The life of human beings began with the creation of two people, a male and a female named Adam and Hawwa (Eve).
The Qur'an describes how Allah created Adam.

	"We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape..." 
	(Quran 15:26)
	
	"He began the creation of man from clay, and made his progeny from a quintessence of fluid"
	(Quran 32:7-8) 

While the creation of Eve is not described in detail, the Qur'an does make it clear that a "mate" was created with Adam, from the same nature and soul. "It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love" (7:189). She is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but in Islamic tradition she is known as "Hawwa" (Eve).

From these two individuals, generations of human beings have inhabited the earth. "Oh humankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, so that you may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honored among you in the sight of Allah is the who is the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things)" (49:13)

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Iblis refused to bow down to Adam</summary>

The Qur‚Äôan tells the story of Iblis several different times, each time offering different facets of the story. The version most relevant for our purposes, is in the seventh sura. God speaks first.

	We created you, We formed you; and then We commanded the angels, "bow down before Adam," and they bowed. But not Iblis; he refused to be one of those who bow.

	God said: "What prevented you from bowing down as I commanded you?" And he [Iblis] said: "I am better than he: You created me from fire and him from clay."

	God said: "Get down from here! Here is no place for your arrogance, Get out! You are the lowest of creatures!"
	but Iblis said, "Give me respite until the day they are raised."
	and God said, "You have respite."
	And then Iblis said, "Because you have put me in the wrong, I shall lie in wait for them on Your straight path; I will assault them from the front and the back, from their right and their left; nor will you find that most of them are grateful."
	God said, "Get out! You are disgraced and expelled! I swear I shall fill Hell with you and all who follow you."

</details>

<details>
	<summary>Creation of Hawwah (Eve)</summary>
Adam‚Äôs spouse, although commonly referred to as Eve or Hawa, is not mentioned by name in the Quran despite being referred to in many places. The details regarding how Eve was created is not mentioned in the Quran. However, it is made evident that Eve was created from Adam. 

	"O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women‚Ä¶." Quran [4:1]

The hadith or traditions of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) further reveal that Eve was created from Adam‚Äôs rib which was taken while he was asleep. The narrations that describe this story of the rib is often used to emphasize being gentle and kind to women. 

‚ÄúO Muslims! I advise you to be gentle with women, for they are created from a rib, and the most crooked portion of the rib is its upper part. If you try to straighten it, it will break, and if you leave it, it will remain crooked; so I urge you to take care of the women.‚Äù [Sahih al-Bukhari 5185; Sahih Muslim 8:3468]

After Eve was created, the couple was given a place in heaven.

	"And We said, ‚ÄòO Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers.‚Äô" Quran [2:35]

Eve was created to accompany Adam as his companion and life partner, and they were instructed to live together in tranquility. In heaven, Adam and Eve were free to eat and enjoy everything with the exception of one tree. 

The Quran does not describe what kind of tree it was, however, this prohibition set the stage for the test that was to come.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Adam and Eve: Eating from Forbidden Tree üöª üêç üå≥ üçé </summary>

Adam and Hawwa disobeyed Allah and ate from the forbidden tree. They asked for forgiveness and Allah forgave them. and they were sent to live on the Earth.

In the Quran, the forbidden tree served as a test for Adam and Eve. Furthermore, God warned Adam and Eve that the devil was an enemy and that they should be on their guard. 

	"So We said, ‚ÄòO Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer.‚Äô" Quran [20:117]

Satan, eagerly targeting the weakness of mankind, tempted Adam and Eve by whispering into their hearts. Claiming to be a sincere advisor, he planted in their minds ideas that would make the forbidden tree appealing. Thoughts of the tree preoccupied both Adam and Eve. Forgetting the warning, they gave in and erred.

	"But Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts. He said, ‚ÄòYour Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal.‚Äô And he swore [by Allah ] to them, ‚ÄòIndeed, I am to you from among the sincere advisors.‚Äô So he made them fall, through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called to them, ‚ÄòDid I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is to you a clear enemy?‚Äô" Quran [7:20-22]

By forgetting God‚Äôs command, Adam and Eve bore equal responsibility for their error. This too was a test for Satan, who in fact, furthered his disobedience by exploiting mankind through their desires. 
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Repentance of Adam and Eve and Allah's Forgiveness</summary>

Through this test, God prepared Adam for his role on earth, as a caretaker and a Prophet. This experience taught Adam firsthand that Satan was a deceptive enemy to mankind. 

After eating from the tree, Adam and Eve became ashamed and deeply regretted their actions. They acknowledged their errors and sought mercy, repenting sincerely [7:23].

The story of Adam and Eve in the Quran teaches the virtue of repentance and supplication. Adam and Eve recognized their errors and prayed for forgiveness. This, in turn, earned them Allah‚Äôs forgiveness and guidance.

"Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him]." Quran [20:122]

</details>


<details>
	<summary><b>Adam and Eve are sent to Earth</b>

In the Quran, God consoles Adam. Since the sin of Adam stemmed from desire, and not from arrogance, his repentance was accepted. They were forgiven but sent to Earth.
 
</summary>
In the Quran, God consoles Adam. Since the sin of Adam stemmed from desire, and not from arrogance, his repentance was accepted. 

‚ÄúThen Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.‚Äù [2:37]

Despite being forgiven, Adam and Eve were no longer granted the comforts of paradise and would be sent to Earth. It is important to note that since Allah had mentioned Adam‚Äôs mission on Earth long before his test, Adam and Eve‚Äôs appointment to earth is not viewed as punishment, instead, it aligns with God‚Äôs Plan. The Quran describes the Earth to Adam and Eve as a place in which to reside and enjoy for a period of time, until the day they die and are resurrected (Quran 7:24-25). 

‚ÄúWe said, ‚ÄòGo down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance ‚Äì there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs ‚Äì those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.‚Äô‚Äù [2:38-39]

Furthermore, Adam is informed by God that he and his progeny will be sent guidance during their time on Earth. In contrast, Satan, unlike Adam, had not begged for forgiveness and had instead requested respite: a chance to mislead and reveal the inadequacy of mankind. God facilitated this request, but warned that Satan would be powerless over the believers. 

Therefore, in the Quran, Adam, Eve, and Satan are all sent down to Earth. On Earth, Adam (pbuh) assumes the role as the first Prophet and the father of mankind.

Adam and Eve had many children. Habyl and Qabyl (Abel and Cain), both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain. 27th verse of chapter 5 (s≈´rat l-mƒÅidah). 
According to the Quran and Bible, lifespan of some prophets was much longer than of modern people. They lived for up to one thousand years.

	<summary><b>Seth</b></summary>

Although the Quran makes no mention of Sheeth ibn Adam, he is revered within Islamic tradition as the third and righteous son of Adam and Eve and seen as the gift bestowed on Adam after the death of Abel.

The Islamic literature holds that Seth was born when Adam was past 100 and that Adam appointed Seth as guide to his people. The 11th-century Syrian historian and translator Al-Mubashshir ibn FƒÅtik recorded the maxims and aphorisms of the ancient philosophers in his book KitƒÅb mukhtƒÅr al-·∏•ikam wa-ma·∏•ƒÅsin al-kalim[16] and included a chapter on Seth. Within Islamic tradition Seth holds wisdom of several kinds; knowledge of time, prophecy of the future Great Flood, and inspiration on the methods of night prayer. Islam, Judaism and Christianity trace the genealogy of mankind back to Seth since Abel left no heirs and Cain's heirs, according to tradition, were destroyed by the Great Flood. Many traditional Islamic crafts are traced back to Seth, such as the making of horn combs

üé∑ flute, music and dancing was invented. According to the Bible, Jubal the descendant of Cain invenved flute and music.

<details>
	<summary><b>Idris (Enoch)</b></summary>

Idris was born when Adam as was alive. Idris is mentioned in the Quran that he was of high class and a prophet. 
ibris was the first to write.

Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, where he is described as a wise man. In surah 19 of the Quran, Maryam, God says:

	"Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:
	And We raised him to a exalted place."
	Quran 19:56‚Äì57

	"And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Dhu al-Kifl,[19] all (men) of constancy and patience;
	We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones."
	Quran 21:85‚Äì86 (Yusuf Ali)

According to later Muslim writings, Idris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, God bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were not yet Muslims. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of the people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of his people left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.

They asked Prophet Idris: "If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?" Prophet Idris said: "If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us." So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: "SubhanAllah."

Islamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when Muhammad began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire. Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of God. Many early commentators, such as Tabari, credited Idris with possessing great wisdom and knowledge.

Exegesis narrates that Idris was among "the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures." These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the "prophet of the philosophers" and a number of works were attributed to him. Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works, all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.

The commentator Ibn Ishaq narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator Ibn Kathir narrated "During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, Ibn Abbas asked Ka‚Äôb what was meant by the part of the verse which says, ‚ÄùAnd We raised him to a high station.‚Äù Ka‚Äôb explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‚ÄòI would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam‚Äôs children‚Äô ‚Äì perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‚ÄòAllah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.‚Äô The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‚ÄòBut where is Idris?‚Äô He replied, ‚ÄòHe is upon my back.‚Äô The angel of death said: ‚ÄòHow astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?‚Äô Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‚ÄòAnd We raised him to a high station.‚Äô

Early accounts of Idris' life attributed "thirty portions of revealed scripture" to him. Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a messenger. Several modern commentators have linked this sentiment with Biblical apocrypha such as the Book of Enoch and the Second Book of Enoch.

In the Bible, Enoch receives visions of how the Earth will be destroyed in the End of Times and how people who did good will receive their reward and how people who did bad deeds will receive their punishment.

## 3. Noah and the Great Flood ‚õ¥ üïä ‚õ∞ 
*************************************

Nuh is the second most narrated prophet in the Quran. he was the first prophet who was sent to people who were commiting shirk. 950 years he has been giving da'wah to his people, only about 10 to 80 people believed him.

<details>
	<summary><b>The Great Flood</b></summary>
According to Islam, he was a prophet, sent to warn mankind of that region and his people to change their ways. He conveyed the message for over 950 years. Islamic literature recounts that in the Generations of Adam, many men and women continued to follow Adam's original teachings, worshiping God alone and remaining righteous. Among Adam's descendants there were many brave and pious men, greatly loved and revered by their respective communities. Exegesis goes on to narrate that, upon the death of these elders, people felt enormous grief and some felt prompted to make statues of these people in remembrance of them. Then gradually, through the generations many forgot what such statues were for and began to worship them, (as the Shaytan (Satan) slowly deceived each generation) along with many other idols. In order to guide the people, God appointed Noah with the duty of being the next prophet to humanity.

#### Early preaching
According to Islamic belief, Noah began preaching to his people both verbally and by example. He would praise God consistently and he urged his people to do the same, warning his tribe of the punishment they would face if they did not mend their ignorant ways. The Qur'an states that Noah repeatedly told his people:

"O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day!"

Noah's ark depicted in a 14th-century manuscript of Rashid al-Din's world history, the Jami al-tawarikh
Early on, a few were moved by Noah's words but the powerful and wealthy members of the tribe refused to hear his call. The unbelievers at the time were impelled to rebel by various evil motives. Firstly, they were extremely envious and jealous of men superior to them in any way. Secondly, the people were ignorant of the weak and lowly, who were frequently superior intellectually, morally and spiritually. As a result of their ignorance, they were arrogant and mocked all who they felt were inferior to them. Saying "Are we to believe you, when those who follow you are the most abject of people?" Noah responded: "Their judgment rests only with my Lord, if you could perceive." When Noah preached the faith of God to them, all they did was revile the messenger, abuse the message and call the whole warning a lie. He then went on to explain the Message in greater depth, ensuring them that it was not a message of destruction but it was a message with the mercy from God, and that their acts would lead to destruction if they did not accept the faith. He questioned them, asking why they would not accept what would benefit them in the near future. Noah went onto further, and told his community that he asked of no reward from them, telling them his only reward would be from God. But his people threatened him with being stoned.

#### Accusation

Miniature from Hafiz-i Abru's Majma al-tawarikh. "Noah's Ark" Iran (Afghanistan), Herat; Timur‚Äôs son Shah Rukh (1405-1447) ordered the historian Hafiz-i Abru to write a continuation of the Jami al-tawarikh. Like the Il-Khanids, the Timurids were concerned with legitimizing their right to rule, and Hafiz-i Abru's "A Collection of Histories" covers a period that included the time of Shah Rukh himself.
As time passed, Noah became firmer in his preaching. When the unbelievers began insulting those who accepted God's message, believing that Noah would send those faithful away to attract the wealthy unbelievers, Noah revealed that they - the arrogant and ignorant rich - were the wicked and sinful ones. His people accused him of being soothsayer or diviner. Noah declared that he was by no means a mere fortune-teller, pretending to reveal secrets which are not worth revealing. Noah also denied accusations claiming he was an angel, always maintaining that he was a human messenger. When the people refused to acknowledge their sinfulness Noah told them that it was not Noah, but God that would punish them - however God pleased.

#### Prayer

A depiction of Noah in a Mughal miniature from the 16th century
The Quran states that Noah prayed to God, telling him that his preaching only made his people disbelieve further. Noah told God how they had closed their minds to accepting the message, so that the light of the truth should not affect their thinking. Noah told God how he had used all the resources of the classical preacher, conveying the message both in public places and with individuals in private. Noah spoke of how he had told the people the rewards they would receive if they became righteous, namely that God would supply plentiful rain as a blessing, and that God would also guarantee them an increase in children and wealth.

#### Building of the Ark

Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh
According to the Quran, one day, Noah received a revelation from God, in which he was told that no one would believe the message now aside from those who have already submitted to God. Noah's frustration at the defiance of his people led him to ask God to not leave even one sinner upon earth.[29] Although there is no proof that God accepted his prayer (as there is many examples of accepted prayers, such as in case of Yunus, Lut (Lot), Suleyman (Solomon) etc., even Noah's prayer in some other shape was accepted), God decreed that a terrible flood would come (and yet, Qur'an doesn't say it came to cover whole Earth) and He ordered Noah to build a ship (Fulk) which would save him and the believers from this dreadful calamity.[41] Ever obedient to God's instructions, Noah went out in search of material with which to build the vessel. When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed at him even more than before. Their conclusion was that he was surely a madman ‚Äì they could not find any other reason why a man would build a huge vessel when no sea or river was nearby.[29] Although Noah was now very old, the aged patriarch continued to work tirelessly until, at last, the Ship was finished.

#### Family
Little is known of Noah's personal history before his call to prophecy. However, Ibn Kathir records him to have been the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah, one of the patriarchs from the Generations of Adam. Noah was neither the leader of the tribe nor a very rich man but, even before being called to prophecy, he worshiped God faithfully and was, in the words of the Qur'an, "a devotee most grateful".

Noah was married to a woman whose name is not mentioned in the Quran. Some Islamic historians such as Al-Tabari have suggested that the name of Noah's wife was Umzarah bint Barakil but this cannot be confirmed. Most Muslims simply call her by her midrashic name Naamah.[citation needed] Islamic scholars agree that Noah had four sons whose names were Ham, Shem, Yam and Japheth. According to the Quran, one of Noah's sons was a disbeliever who refused to come aboard the Ark, instead preferring to climb a mountain, where he drowned. It is agreed among most Islamic scholars that Yam was the one who drowned; the other three remained believers.

The Quran states that Noah's wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him; neither did one of Noah's sons (Yam), who was secretly a disbeliever but had pretended faith in front of Noah. The sons of Noah are not expressly mentioned in the Qur'an, except for the fact that one of the sons was among the people who did not follow his own father, not among the believers and thus was washed away in the flood.[44] Also the Qur'an indicates a great calamity, enough to have destroyed Noah's people, but to have saved him and his generations to come. Noah's wife (Naamah) is referred to in the Qur'an as an evil woman. When God emphasizes upon the notion that everyone is for themselves on the Day of Judgement and that marital relations will not be to your aid when the judgement takes place.

In contrast, the wife of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Asiya, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are referred to as among the best of women. This adds to the notion that, on the Last Day, everyone will be judged according to their own deeds. The "Stories of The Prophets" explain that the son who declined to embark was a non-believer.
After the flood, humankind started over and for some time they lived in tawhid.

<summary><b>Historic Side-Note </b></summary>
Here the examples of all old nations among which existed the story of the great flood.

Story of the great flood occurs in:
the Mesopotamian flood stories, the Genesis flood narrative, Nuh (Noah) in Islam, manvantara-sandhya in Hinduism, the Gun-Yu in Chinese mythology, Deucalion and Pyrrha in Greek mythology, Bergelmir in Norse mythology, the arrival of the first inhabitants of Ireland with Cessair in Irish mythology, in parts of Polynesia such as Hawaii, the lore of the K'iche' and Maya peoples in Mesoamerica, the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa tribe of Native Americans in North America, the Muisca and Ca√±ari Confederation in South America, Africa, and some Aboriginal tribes in Australia.

One example of a flood myth is the Epic of Gilgamesh. Many scholars believe that this account was copied from the Akkadian Atra-Hasis,[a] which dates to the 18th century BC.[3][b] In the Gilgamesh flood myth, the highest god, Enlil, decides to destroy the world with a flood because humans have become too noisy. The god Ea, who had created humans out of clay and divine blood, secretly warns the hero Utnapishtim of the impending flood and gives him detailed instructions for building a boat so that life may survive.[5][6] Both the Epic of Gilgamesh and Atra-Hasis are preceded by the similar Sumerian creation myth (c. 1600 BC)[7]‚Äîthe oldest surviving example of such a flood-myth narrative, known from tablets found in the ruins of Nippur.

<summary><b>Saleh and people of Thamud üê™</b></summary>

(Selah?)

Thamud were a tribal confederation in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mentioned in Assyrian sources in the time of Sargon II. The tribe's name continues to appear in documents into the fourth century CE, but by the sixth century they were regarded as a group that had vanished long ago.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Open history of Thamud </b></summary>
<p>
According to the Quran, the city that Saleh was sent to was called al-Hijr, which corresponds to the Nabataean city of Hegra. The city rose to prominence around the first century AD as an important site in the regional caravan trade. Adjacent to the city were large, decorated rock-cut tombs used by members of various religious groups.
</p><p>
Saleh's life in his community had been so righteous that the people of Thamud virtually relied upon him for support. He was chosen by God as a Messenger and sent to preach against the selfishness of the wealthy and to condemn the practice of Shirk (Idolatry or Polytheism). Although Saleh preached the message for a sustained period of time, the people for Thamud refused to hear his warning and instead began to ask Saleh to perform a miracle for them. They said: "O Salih! Thou hast been of us! A centre of our hopes hitherto! Dost thou forbid us the worship of what our fathers worshiped? But we are really in suspicious (disquieting) doubt as to that to which thou invitest us."
</p><p>
Saleh reminded his people of the countless castles and palaces they built out of stone, and of their technological superiority over neighboring communities. Furthermore, he told them about their ancestors, the  øƒÄd tribe, and how they too were destroyed for their sins. Some of the people of Thamud believed Saleh's words, but the tribal leaders refused to listen to him and continued to demand that he demonstrate a miracle to prove his prophethood.
</p><p>
In response, God gave the Thamud a blessed she-camel, as both a means of sustenance and a test. The tribe was told to allow the camel to graze peacefully and avoid harming her. But in defiance of Saleh's warning, the people of the tribe hamstrung the camel. Saleh informed them that they had only three more days to live before the wrath of God descended upon them. The people of the city were remorseful, but their crime could not be undone, and all the disbelieving people in the city were killed in an earthquake. Al-Hijr was rendered uninhabited and remained in ruins for all time thereafter. Saleh himself and the few believers who followed him survived.
</p><p>
The story is expanded upon in S≈´rat an-Naml, whilst the she-camel is not mentioned explicitly here, it states that nine men plotted to kill Salih and his whole family, a crime for which they were struck down by God 3 days later.

  <summary>History</summary>
There is no agreed opinion on how many generations passed from Adam till Nuh, from Nuh till Ibrahim. The jewish sources clain that the humanity lived only 6000 years but Muslims don't have this fixed timeline, we can extrapolate. there is scientific evidence that Homo-Sapiens existed for ...
and the prophet Muhammad saw said that the distance between me and Al Kiyamah is like distance between my two fingers.

Ibrahim was born in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees in the Ancient Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). Ibrahim traditionally believed to have lived some time in the 2nd millennium BC.
In Jewish and Islamic traditions a confrontation between Nimrod and Abraham is said to have taken place. 
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Early Life</summary>

**Ibrahim**: Ibrahim is from Iraq, Hagar is from Egypt. Hajj was established by Ibrahim. Kurban was established by the example of Ibrahim and his son. Ibrahim had two sons Iskhak and Ishmael. Iskhak became the father of Jewish people. Ismail helped Ibrahim to build the Kaaba and became the father of Arab people.

Ibrahim was born in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called 'Ur' in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion.

His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ebrahem would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always scold him for not following his ancestors' rituals and mocking their idols.

When Ibrahim was young he used to laugh whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.

One night, Abraham went up to the mountain, leaned against a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, "Could this be my Lord?" But when it set he said: "I don't like those that set." The star had disappeared so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor and said, "Could this be my Lord?" but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" But when the sun also set he said, "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." After this declaration, Abraham then heard Allah calling him, "O Abraham " Abraham trembled and said, "Here I am O my Lord!" Allah replied, "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!"Abraham fell to the ground, crying. He said: "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" Abraham kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.

	<summary>Soddom and Homorra (Story of Lut (Lot))</summary>

Lut (Arabic: ŸÑŸàÿ∑, romanized: L≈´·π≠), known as Lot in the Old Testament, is a prophet of God in the Quran. According to Islamic tradition, Lut was born to Haran and spent his younger years in Ur, later migrating to Canaan with his uncle Abraham. He was sent to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a prophet, and was commanded to preach to their inhabitants on monotheism and the sinfulness of homosexuality and their lustful and violent acts.

Though Lut was not born among the people he'd been sent to preach to, the people of Sodom are still regarded as his "brethren" in the Quran. Like the Biblical narrative, the Quran states that Lut's messages were ignored by the inhabitants of the cities, and Sodom and Gomorrah were subsequently destroyed. The destruction of the cities is traditionally presented as a warning against male rape and went on to be used as a warning against homosexual acts.

While the Quran does not elaborate upon Lut's later life, Islam holds that all prophets were examples of moral and spiritual righteousness.

Lut is referenced a relatively large number of times in the Quran. Many of these passages place the narrative of Lut in a line of successive prophets including Noah, Hud, Salih and Shuayb. Islamic scholars have stated that these particular prophets represent the early cycle of prophecy as described in the Quran. These narratives typically follow similar patterns: a prophet is sent to a community; the community pays no heed to his warnings instead threatens him with punishment; God asks the prophet to leave with his followers the community and its people are subsequently destroyed in a punishment. Elsewhere in the Quran, Lut is mentioned alongside Ismael, Elisha and Jonah as men whom God favored above the nations.

The Quran states that Lut was a nephew of Abraham who had been sent to the twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a prophet after migrating to Canaan, but he was rejected by the cities' inhabitants. One day, a group of angels visited Abraham as guests in the guise of handsome men in order to inform him of the fact that his wife Sarah was pregnant with Isaac. While there, they also told him that they had been sent by God to the "guilty people" of Lut to destroy them with "a shower of stones of clay".[16] Lut and those who believed in him, were to be spared, but his wife was to die in the destruction, with the angels stating that "she is of those who lag behind". The Quran also draws upon Lot's wife as an "example for the unbelievers" as she was married to a righteous man but refused to believe in his message and was thus condemned to Hell.

The people of the twin cities transgressed against the bounds of God. According to the Quran, their sins included inhospitality and robbery  they hated strangers and robbed travellers, apart from other abuses and rape. It was their sin of sexual misconduct as well which was seen as particularly egregious, with Lut strongly chiding them for approaching men with sexual desire instead of women. Lut told and tried to help them to abandon their sinful ways, but they ridiculed him[20] and threatened to evict him from the cities. Lut prayed to God and begged to be saved from the consequences of their sinful acts.

Then three angels, disguised as handsome males, came to Lut as guests. He grieved the men, as he felt powerlessness to protect them from the people of the cities. The cities' residents becoming aware of the visitors demanded that Lot surrender his guests to them. Distressed and fearful that they would incur the wrath of God, suggested rather lawful marriage to his daughters as pious and purer alternatives to their unlawful wishes, and perhaps as a source of guidance. But they were unrelenting and replied "thou knowest we have no need of thy daughters: indeed thou knowest quite well what we desire!", referring to his male guests.

The exegetes Ibn Kathir, Qurtubi and Tabari do not read 'daughters' to mean Lot's literal daughters. They argue that since a prophet is like a father to his nation, Lot was directing the evildoers to turn away from their sins and engage in healthy and pious relationships with the daughters of the nation, i.e. women in general.

The angels then revealed their true identities to Lot and said to him, ‚ÄúWe are (here) to deliver thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind." They advised Lot to leave the cities during the night, telling him not to look back. Keeping his faith in God, Lot left the cities in the darkness of night, bringing with him his followers and believing family members. Finally, morning came, and the Decree of God passed whereupon the Quran reads, ‚ÄúWe turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-‚Äú[32] And thus was sealed the fate of the twin cities, falling into destruction and despair and marking the end of the civilisations of Sodom and Gomorrah.

	<summary>The Covenant</summary>

According to the Bible, God makes a covenant with Abraham and says that He will make Abraham a father of many nations. He gets old and still doesn't have children but doesn't lose his faith. Sarah wants to force the promise by giving Hagar to Abraham so that she can conceive a child. and she gives birth to Ismail.
God says that the sign of the covenant is circumcision.
When Abraham was around 100 years old, three angels come to Abraham and bring them the good news that Sarah will conveive a child. Sarah laughs because she is very old but angels tell her that this is the will of God. and Sarah gives birth to Ishaq.

After having her own son, she tells Abraham to send away Hagar and Ismail so that Ismail doesn't cause a threat to the inheritance of Ishaq. God also tells Abraham to send them away and he leaves them in Mecca. Hagar asks if that is the will of Abraham or the will of God and feels relieved because it was the will of God. While they leave there in the wilderness, they run out of water and Hagar runs from one hill to the other to see if there's caravan. God sends them an angel that tells Hagar that God hears Ishmael crying and the angels comforts them and finds them a water spring. Muslims believe this is the spring of Zamzam which fulfills the thirst of piligrims in Mecca up to recent days.
After having a water source some caravan tribes ask permission to settle in that area. Ishmael grows and Hagar finds him a wife from Egypt.

According to Bible: As had been prophesied in Mamre the previous year,[40] Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham, on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Abraham was "an hundred years old", when his son whom he named Isaac was born; and he circumcised him when he was eight days old.[41] For Sarah, the thought of giving birth and nursing a child, at such an old age, also brought her much laughter, as she declared, "God hath made me to laugh, so that all who hear will laugh with me."[42] Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion. During the celebration, however, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac.

	Ishaq is the father of Yaqub and grandfather of Yusuf.

	Islam considers Isaac (Arabic:ÿßÿ≥ÿ≠ÿßŸÇ Ishaaq) a prophet of Islam, and describes him as the father of the Israelites and a righteous servant of God.

Isaac, along with Ishmael, is highly important for Muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father Abraham. Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch Jacob, who is also venerated as an Islamic prophet.

Isaac is mentioned seventeen times by name in the Quran, often with his father and his son, Jacob.[36] The Quran states that Abraham received "good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous", and that God blessed them both (37: 112). In a fuller description, when angels came to Abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah, his wife, Sarah, "laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob" (11: 71‚Äì74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a "gift" to Abraham (6: 84; 14: 49‚Äì50), and 24: 26‚Äì27 adds that God made "prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph. In the Quran, it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (14: 39‚Äì41).

Elsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of God's favor to them (12: 6); Jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, "Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the Quran commands Muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84). In the Quran's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son (37: 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith.

Quran
The Quran mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of God. Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only and were righteous leaders in the way of God:

And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them).
And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).

‚Äî‚ÄâQuran, sura 21 (Al-Anbiya), ayah 72‚Äì73
And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, and one of the righteous.

‚Äî‚ÄâQuran, sura 37 (As-Saaffat), ayah 112

	<summary>Ismail (Ishmael) (beginning of Arabic people)</summary>
name Yishmael means God will hear
First son of Ibrahim.

Ismael (Arabic: ÿ•ÿ≥ŸÖÿßÿπŸäŸÑ, romanized:  æIsmƒÅ øƒìl) is regarded as a prophet and messenger and the founder of Ishmaelites in Islam. He is the son of EbrƒÅhƒìm (Abraham), born to HƒÅjar (Hagar). Ismael is also associated with Mecca and the construction of the Kaaba. Ismael is considered the ancestor to Muhammad.

Ismael is the figure known as Ishmael in Judaism and Christianity. These sources include the Quran, Quranic commentary (tafsir), hadith, historiographic collections like that of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, and Isra'iliyat (Islamic texts about Biblical or ancient Israelite figures that originate from Jewish or Christian sources).
Ishmael and Hagar taken to Mecca by Abraham
Ishmael and Hagar being taken to Mecca by Abraham in Islamic texts[4] is an important part in the story of Ishmael, as it brings the focus to Mecca and is the beginning of Mecca's sanctification as a holy area.[2]:‚Ää61‚Ää Islamic tradition says Abraham was ordered by God to take Hagar and Ishmael to Mecca, and later Abraham returned to Mecca to build the Kaaba.[5] In many of these accounts, the Sakina (something like a wind or spirit sent by God), or the angel Gabriel (Jibral) guides them to the location of the Kaaba, at which point Abraham builds it and afterwards, leaves the other two there (other versions discussed below say the construction of the Kaaba occurred later and that Ishmael took part in it). Generally, it is said that Hagar asks Abraham who he is entrusting herself and Ishmael to as he leaves them. He answers that he is entrusting them to God, to which Hagar then makes a reply that shows her faith, stating that she believes God will guide them. Hagar and Ishmael then run out of water and Ishmael becomes extremely thirsty. Hagar is distressed and searches for water, running back and forth seven times between the hills of Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. Hagar is later remembered by Muslims for this act during the Hajj, or pilgrimage, in which Muslims run between these same hills as part of the Sa'yee.[6] When she returns to Ishmael, she finds either him or an angel scratching the ground with their heel or finger, whereupon water begins flowing and Hagar collects some or dams it up. This spring or well is known as Zamzam. At some point, a passing tribe known as the Jurhum sees birds circling the water and investigates. They ask Hagar if they can settle there, which she allows, and many versions say as Ishmael grew up he learned various things from the tribe. There are numerous versions of this story, each differing in various ways. The versions used in this summary, as well as others, can be found in al-Tabari's history[7] and are recounted in Reuven Firestone's Journeys in Holy Lands.[2]

Muslims believe that Abraham was told to sacrifice his son, Ishmael, though the Qur'an does not mention the name of the son. The multiple versions suggest that the dhabih was originally an oral story that had been circulating before being written as it is in the Qur'an and in additional commentaries.[8]:‚Ää92‚Äì95‚Ää Norman Calder explains, "oral narrative is marked by instability of form and detail from version to version, and by an appropriate creative flexibility which makes of every rendering a unique work of art."[8]:‚Ää92‚Äì93‚Ää Each version is indeed a "unique work of art," differing from another in various ways to present certain ideas, such as the importance of Ishmael over Isaac because he was the first child.


Abraham sacrificing his son, Ishmael; Abraham cast into fire by Nimrod
The general narrative pertaining to Ishmael in Islamic literature describes the sacrifice either as a test or as part of a vow. Some versions tell of the devil trying to stop God's command from being obeyed by visiting Hagar, Ishmael, and Abraham. Every time the devil says Abraham is going to sacrifice Ishmael, each person answers that if God commanded it, they should obey. Eventually, Abraham tells Ishmael about the order and Ishmael is willing to be sacrificed and encourages Abraham to listen to God. Often, Ishmael is portrayed as telling Abraham some combination of instructions to bring his shirt back to Hagar, bind him tightly, sharpen the knife, and place him face down, all so that there will be no wavering in the resolve to obey God.

As Abraham attempts to slay Ishmael, either the knife is turned over in his hand or copper appears on Ishmael to prevent the death and God tells Abraham that he has fulfilled the command. Unlike in the Bible, there is no mention in the Qur'an of an animal (ram) replacing the boy; rather he is replaced with a 'great sacrifice' (dhib·∏•in  øa·∫ìƒ´m).[9] Since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of Abraham's son (and a prophet in Islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future self-sacrifices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of Ishmael) in the cause of their faith. Every Eid al-Adha once a year Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Abraham's sacrifice and to remind themselves of self-abnegation in the way of Allah.[10] Later historiographic literature incorporates the Biblical narrative in which a ram is provided which is slaughtered instead of Ishmael.

The actions of Ishmael in this narrative have led him to become a prominent model of hospitality and obedience. This story in the Quran is unique when compared to that in the Bible because Abraham talks with his son, whichever it is believed to be, and the son is thus aware of the plan to become a sacrifice and approves of it. As noted above, in some versions, Ishmael makes sure in different ways that neither he nor his father hesitate in their obedience to God. In this way, Ishmael is a model of surrendering one's will to God, an essential characteristic in Islam.

Though it is generally believed by modern Muslims that Ishmael was the son who was almost sacrificed, among scholars and historiographers of early Islam, there is much debate. There are such persuasive arguments for both, in fact, it is estimated that 131 traditions say Isaac was the son, while 133 say Ishmael.[2]:‚Ää135‚Ää Such dispute over which son suggests that the story, and where and to whom it happens, is extremely important.[2]:‚Ää144‚Ää It is argued that the story originated from rabbinic texts and was adapted to Islam over time in order to give Mecca religious importance and connect the story with the pilgrimage.[8]:‚Ää87‚ÄäArguments by early Muslim scholars for Ishmael as the intended sacrifice include that Jews claim it is Isaac only because they are jealous that it was actually the ancestor of Arabs, Ishmael, and that the horns of the ram that was sacrificed instead hung in the Kaaba at one time.[7]:‚Ää88‚Äì90‚Ää In looking solely at the text of the Quran to determine which son was to be sacrificed, there still are various views. The strongest case for Ishmael in the Quran is that directly after the sacrifice narrative, Abraham is told of the coming of Isaac's birth, therefore, it must be Ishmael who was about to be sacrificed.[7]:‚Ää88‚Ää However Tabari argues that because it is only Isaac who is indicated by birth announcements that the announcement at the start of the sacrifice narrative, "So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy" refers to Isaac.[2]:‚Ää135‚Äì136‚Ää[7]:‚Ää89‚Ää Authentic hadiths are said to not contradict each other because that negates the definition of the hadith.

Construction of the Kaaba
At some point, often believed to be after Hagar's death, Ishmael married a woman from the Jurhum, the tribe who settled in the area around Zamzam. Abraham visited Ishmael in Mecca and when he arrived at his home, Ishmael was not there. Instead Ishmael's wife greets Abraham, but she was not welcoming or generous to him. Abraham instructed her to tell Ishmael some version of the statement that he was not pleased with or to change "the threshold of his door." When Ishmael returns home and his wife told him that, he knows it is from his father and taking the advice, divorced the woman. He then married another woman from Jurhum. Abraham once again visited and was met by Ishmael's second wife, as Ishmael was out. This wife was very kind and provided food for him. Abraham instructed her to tell Ishmael some version of the statement that he was pleased with "the threshold of his door." When Ishmael arrived and his wife repeated Abraham's statement, Ishmael knew it was from his father and kept his wife.

There are many versions of the construction of the Kaaba that differ in fairly significant ways, although all have Abraham build or cleanse the Kaaba and then immediately after, or at an unknown time, God called Abraham to establish the Hajj, or pilgrimage. These narratives differ in when these events occurred, if and how there was supernatural involvement, the inclusion or omission of the Black Stone, and whether Ishmael assisted his father. Of those that say Ishmael took part in the construction, most describe Abraham visited Ishmael a third time in Mecca, during which they raised the Kaaba. Some say Ishmael looked for a final stone, but Abraham did not accept the one he brought back. Instead an angel had brought the Black Stone, which Abraham put into place. Ishmael was left at the Kaaba, in charge of its care and to teach others about the Hajj. The starting of the Hajj has many versions, and some scholars believe this reflects the late association of Abraham with the Hajj after Islam had developed to help remove its connection to early pagan rituals.[2]:‚Ää101‚Ää

	<summary>Yaqub</summary>
Jacob was later renamed to Israel.

#### Yaqub in the Quran and Hadith
Two further references to Isra'il (Arabic: ÿ•Ÿêÿ≥Ÿíÿ±Ÿéÿ¢ÿ¶Ÿê€åŸÑ [ÀàisraƒÅÀàiyl]; Classical/ Quranic Arabic: ÿ•Ÿêÿ≥Ÿíÿ±Ÿéÿ¢ÿ°Ÿê€åŸíŸÑ [ÀàisraƒÅ√£Ààiyl]) are believed to be mention of Jacob. The Arabic form Ya'q≈´b (Arabic: ŸäŸéÿπŸíŸÇŸèŸàÿ®, romanized: Ya øq≈´b may be direct from the Hebrew or indirect through Syriac.[91]

He is recognized in Islam as a prophet who received inspiration from God. He is acknowledged as a patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that he preached the same monotheistic faith as his forefathers  æIbrƒÅhƒ´m,  æIs·∏•ƒÅq and IsmƒÅ'ƒ´l. Jacob is mentioned 16 times in the Quran.[92] In the majority of these references, Jacob is mentioned alongside fellow prophets and patriarchs as an ancient and pious prophet. According to the Quran, Jacob remained in the company of the elect throughout his life. (38:47) The Quran specifically mentions that Jacob was guided (6:84) and inspired (4:163) and was chosen to enforce the awareness of the Hereafter. (38:46) Jacob is described as a good-doer (21:72) and the Quran further makes it clear that God inspired Jacob to contribute towards purification and hold the contact prayer. (21:73) Jacob is further described as being resourceful and a possessor of great vision (38:45) and is further spoken of as being granted a "tongue [voice] of truthfulness to be heard." (19:50)

Of the life of Jacob, the Quran narrates two especially important events. The first is the role he plays in the story of his son Joseph. The Quran narrates the story of Joseph in detail, and Jacob, being Joseph's father, is mentioned thrice and is referenced another 25 times.[92] In the narrative, Jacob does not trust some of his older sons (12: 11, 18, 23) because they do not respect him. (12: 8, 16‚Äì17) Jacob's prophetic nature is evident from his foreknowledge of Joseph's future greatness (12:6), his foreboding and response to the supposed death of Joseph (12: 13, 18) and in his response to the sons' plight in Egypt. (12: 83, 86‚Äì87, 96) Islamic literature fleshes out the narrative of Jacob, and mentions that his wives included Rachel.[93] Jacob is later mentioned in the Quran in the context of the promise bestowed to Zechariah, regarding the birth of John the Baptist. (19:6) Jacob's second mention is in the Quran's second chapter. As Jacob lay on his deathbed, he asked his 12 sons to testify their faith to him before he departed from this world to the next. (2:132) Each son testified in front of Jacob that they would promise to remain Muslim (in submission to God) until the day of their death, that is they would surrender their wholeselves to God alone and would worship only Him.

In contrast to the Judeo-Christian view of Jacob, one main difference is that the story of Jacob's blessing, in which he deceives Isaac, is not accepted in Islam. The Quran makes it clear that Jacob was blessed by God as a prophet and, therefore, Muslims believe that his father, being a prophet as well, also knew of his son's greatness.[94] Jacob is also cited in the Hadith as an example of one who was patient and trusting in God in the face of suffering.

#### Yaqub in the Bible

The biblical account of the life of Jacob is found in the Book of Genesis, chapters 25‚Äì50.

##### Birth
Jacob and his twin brother, Esau, were born to Isaac and Rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when Isaac was 60 years of age.[10] Rebecca was uncomfortable during her pregnancy and went to inquire of God why she was suffering. She received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives, even after they became two separate nations. The prophecy also said that "the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger" (Genesis 25:25 KJV).

When the time came for Rebecca to give birth, the firstborn, Esau, came out covered with red hair, as if he were wearing a hairy garment, and his heel was grasped by the hand of Jacob, the secondborn. According to Genesis 25, Isaac and Rebecca named the first son Hebrew: ◊¢◊©◊ï, Esau.[11] The second son they named ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë, Jacob (Ya'aqob or Ya'aqov, meaning "heel-catcher", "supplanter", "leg-puller", "he who follows upon the heels of one", from Hebrew: ◊¢◊ß◊ë, 'aqab or 'aqav, "seize by the heel", "circumvent", "restrain", a wordplay upon Hebrew: ◊¢◊ß◊ë◊î, 'iqqebah or 'iqqbah, "heel").[12]

The boys displayed very different natures as they matured. "... and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a simple man, dwelling in tents".[13] Moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: "And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebecca loved Jacob."[

##### Blessing of Isaac
As Isaac aged, he became blind and was uncertain when he would die, so he decided to bestow Esau's birthright upon him. He requested that Esau go out to the fields with his weapons (quiver and bow) to kill some venison. Isaac then requested that Esau make "savory meat" for him out of the venison, according to the way he enjoyed it the most, so that he could eat it and bless Esau.

Rebecca overheard this conversation. It is suggested that she realized prophetically that Isaac's blessings would go to Jacob, since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger.

The Bible tells the story of how Rebecca and JAcob deceived blind Isaac to get the blessing instead of Esau. In the Muslim tradition we believe that Ishak and Yaqub being prophets would not do so.

	<summary>Historicity</summary>
Although archaeologist and biblical scholar William F. Albright maintained (c. 1961) that the narratives of Abraham and Jacob could be dated to about the 19th century BCE;[98], John J. Bimson wrote in 1980: "Since then ... there has been a strong reaction against the use of archaeological evidence in support of the biblical traditions, and Albright's comment could not be repeated with any truth today."[98] Nahum M. Sarna (1978) noted that an inability to date the narratives of the patriarchs does not necessarily invalidate their historicity,[98] a view supported by Bimson, who admitted that "Our knowledge of the centuries around 2000 BC is very small, and our ignorance very great."

Historicity of the Egyptian episode
According to researches on the historicity of the Old Testament, the descent of Abraham into Egypt as recorded in Genesis 12:10‚Äì20 should correspond to the early years of the 2nd millennium BCE, which is before the time the Hyksos ruled in Egypt, but would coincide with the Semitic parties known to have visited the Egyptians circa 1900 BCE, as documented in the painting of a West-Asiatic procession of the tomb of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan.[106] It might be possible to associate Abraham to such known Semitic visitors to Egypt, as they would have been ethnically connected.[106][107] The period of Joseph and Jacob/Israel in Egypt (Genesis 39:50), where they were in favour at the Egyptian court and Joseph held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land, would correspond to the time the Hyksos ruled in Egypt, during the Fifteenth Dynasty.[106] The time of Moses and the expulsion to Palestine related in The Exodus could also correspond to the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt.[

	<summary>Yusuf</summary>

Yusuf ibn Yaqub ibn Ishaaq ibn Ibrahim (Arabic: ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ Ÿ±ÿ®ŸÜ ŸäÿπŸÇŸàÿ® Ÿ±ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ•ÿ≥ÿ≠ÿßŸÇ Ÿ±ÿ®ŸÜ ÿ•ÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸáŸäŸÖ) (Joseph, son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Abraham) is a prophet mentioned in the Quran,[1] and corresponds to Joseph, a person from the Tanakh, the Jewish religious scripture, and the Christian Bible, who was estimated to have lived in Egypt before the New Kingdom.[2] It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations. Of all of Jacob's children, Joseph was the one given the gift of prophecy. Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various Surahs, the complete narrative of Joseph is given only in one Surah, Yusuf, making it unique. It is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart.[3]

Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Yaqub (Arabic: ŸäÿπŸÇŸàÿ®, Yaqub), and, according to many scholars, his favorite. According to Ibn Kathir, "Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites. The noblest, the most exalted, the greatest of them was Joseph."[4] The story begins with Joseph revealing a dream he had to his father, which Jacob recognizes.[5] In addition to the role of God in his life, the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha (Potiphar's wife of the Old Testament) became a popular subject in Persian literature, where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries.

The story of Joseph in the Qur æƒÅn is a continuous narrative. There are more than one hundred verses, and in totality they encompass many years and "present an amazing variety of sciences and characters in a tightly-knit plot, and offer a dramatic illustration of some of the fundamental themes of the Qur æƒÅn."[7] The Qur æƒÅn itself relates to the story's importance in the third verse: "and We narrate unto you a·∏•sanal-qa·π£a·π£ (Arabic: ÿ£ÿ≠ÿ≥ŸÜ Ÿ±ŸÑŸÇÿµÿµ, "best (or most beautiful) of stories")." Most scholars believe this is referring to Joseph's story, while others, including ·π¨abari, argue it is a reference to the Qur æƒÅn as a whole.[8] It asserts and documents the execution of God's rulings despite the challenge of human intervention ("And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not").[9]

This is what the story of Y≈´suf confirms categorically, for it ends with comfort and marvels, which is described in the Qur æƒÅn. Along with the story there is also some commentary from some leading scholars of Islam.

#### Joseph before the dream
Muhammad at-·π¨abari provides exquisite detail and commentary of this narrative in his chapter on Joseph relaying the opinions of well-known scholars. In ·π¨abari's chapter, the physical beauty of Joseph and his mother Rahyl is introduced, in that they were said to have had "more beauty than any other human being."[10] His father, Jacob, had given him to his oldest sister to be raised. ·π¨abari comments that there was no greater love than what Joseph's aunt felt for him as she had raised him as her own. And she was very reluctant to give him back to Jacob and kept him until her death. The reason, according to ·π¨abari, that she was able to do this was because of a belt that had been passed to her from her father, Isaac. ·π¨abari notes "if someone else acquired it by guile from the person who was supposed to have it, then he would become absolutely subject to the will of the rightful owner."[11] This is important because Joseph's aunt puts the belt on Joseph when Jacob is absent and then accuses Joseph of stealing it and he thus stays with her until her death. Jacob was very reluctant to give up Joseph and thus favors him when they are together. This is commentary but, as is the profession of commentators, this provides an interesting set up to Joseph's personal story and also lays a foundation for a future interaction with his brothers, particularly Benjamin.

#### The dream
The story begins with a dream and ends with its interpretation. As the sun appeared over the horizon, bathing the earth in its morning glory, Joseph, son of Jacob awoke from his sleep, delighted by a pleasant dream he had. Filled with excitement he ran to his father and reported what he had seen.

	Yusuf said to his father: "O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!
	Qur'an 12:4[12]

According to Ibn Kathir, Jacob knew that Joseph would someday become extremely important and would be in a high position, both in this world and the next‚Äîhe recognized that the stars represented his brothers and the sun and moon represented himself and Joseph's mother, Rachel. Jacob advised Joseph to keep the dream to himself in order to protect him from the jealousy of his brothers, who were already unhappy about the love Jacob felt for Joseph.[13] Ya'qub foresaw that Yusuf would be one through whom the prophecy of his grandfather, Ibrahim (Abraham), would be fulfilled, in that his offspring would keep the light of Abraham's house alive and spread God's message to mankind. Abu Ya'ala interpreted Jacob's reaction as an understanding that the planets, sun and moon bowing to Joseph representing "something dispersed which God united."[13]

	Ya'qub told Yusuf: "My son, relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is a clear enemy to humanity. Thus your Lord has selected you and given you knowledge to interpret reports, and has perfected his blessing upon you and upon the family of Jacob just as he perfected it on your forefathers before: Ibrahim and Is-haq (Isaac). Your Lord is Knowing, Wise" (Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 5-6).[14]

Joseph did not tell his brothers his dream, unlike in the version relayed in the Hebrew Bible, but their dislike of him was already too strong to subdue. ·π¨abari demonstrates this by adding that they said to each other, "verily Joseph and his brother (Benjamin) are dearer to our father than we are, though we may be a troop ('usbah). By usbah they meant a group, for they were ten in number. They said, "Our father is plainly in a state of aberration.""[15]

Joseph was known, in addition for being very handsome, to be of gentle temperament. He was respectful, kind and considerate. His brother Benjamin was equally pleasant and both were from the same mother, Rachel. From a hadith (Arabic: ÿ≠ÿØŸäÿ´, 'narration'):

Narrated Abu Huraira:
Some people asked the Prophet: "Who is the most honorable amongst the people?" He replied, "The most honorable among them is the one who is the most Allah-fearing." They said, "O Prophet of Allah! We do not ask about this." He said, "Then the most honorable person is Yusuf, Nabiyyullah (Arabic: ŸÜÿ®Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá, Prophet of Allah), the son of a Nabiyyillah, the son of a Nabiyyillah, the son of Khalilillah (Arabic: ÿÆŸÑŸäŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá, "Friend of Allah")."
‚Äî‚ÄâSahih al-Bukhari collected by Muhammad al-Bukhari[16]

#### The plot against Joseph

Selling Joseph as a slave. Painting in Takieh Moaven ol molk, Kermanshah, Iran
The Qur æƒÅn continues with Joseph's brothers plotting to kill him. It relates: "in Joseph and his brothers are signs for those who seek answers. When Joseph's brother said about him: "He is more loved by our father than we are, and we are a group. Our father is in clear error. Let us kill Joseph or cast him to the ground, so that the face of your father will be toward you, and after him you will be a community of the truthful."[17]

But one of the brothers argued against killing him and suggested they throw him into a well, said to be Jubb Yusif (Arabic: ÿ¨ÿ® ŸäŸàÿ≥ŸÅ, "Well of Joseph"), so that a caravan might pick him up and take him into slavery. Mujahid, a scholar, says that it was Simeon and Suddi says it was Judah while Qatadah and Ibn Is-haq says that it was the eldest, Ruben.[18] Said one of them: "Slay not Joseph, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers."[19]

Killing Joseph because of jealousy would have been extreme, but scholars also suggested that Joseph was fairly young when he was thrown into the well, as young as twelve.[20] He would live to be 110[21] or 120.[20]

The brothers asked their father to let them take Joseph out to the desert to play and promised to watch him. Jacob, not thrilled with the idea knowing how much the brothers disliked Joseph, hesitated. ·π¨abari comments that Jacobs's excuse was that a dhi'b (Arabic: ÿ∞ÿ¶ÿ®, wolf) might hurt him.[22] But the brothers insisted. When they had Joseph alone they threw him into a well and left him there, They returned with a blood stained shirt and lied that he had been attacked by a wolf, but their father did not believe them, as he was a sincere man who loved his son.[22]

The Qur'an says:

	They said: "O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Joseph,- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?
	Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him."
	(Jacob) said: "Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him."
	They said: "If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves!"
	So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): 'Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not'
	Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping.
	They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Joseph with our things; and the wolf devoured him.... But thou wilt never believe us even if we tell the truth."
	They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: "Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is Allah (alone) Whose help can be sought"...
	Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 11-18[23]

·π¨abari comments that Judah stopped the brothers from causing more harm to Joseph, and that he would bring him food.[22] Ibn Kathir comments that Reuben suggested that they put him in the pit so that he might return later to bring him home. But when he returned, he found Joseph gone. "So he screamed and tore his clothes. He put blood on the coat of Joseph. When Jacob learned of this, he tore his clothes, wore a black cloak, and was sad for many days."[24] Ibn 'Abbas writes that the "reason for this trial of Jacob was that he had slaughtered a sheep while he was fasting. He asked a neighbor of his to eat it but he did not. So God tested him with the matter of Joseph."[25] The section that describes Joseph's revelation in the well is interpreted by Ibn 'Abbas: "When they were unaware" (12:15) means "you will tell them about what they did in a situation in which they will not recognize you."[26] This is yet more foreshadowing. A possible reason for his enslavement was that after Abraham had left Egypt he took slaves with him but "Abraham did not dismount for them (following barefoot). Therefore God revealed to him: "Since you did not alight for the slaves and those walking barefoot with you, I will punish you by selling one of your descendants into his country.""[27]

#### God's plan to save Joseph
A passing caravan took Joseph. They had stopped by the well hoping to draw water to quench their thirst and saw the boy inside. So they retrieved him and sold him into slavery in Misr (Arabic: ŸÖÿµÿ±, Egypt), to a rich man referred to as "Al-'Aziz" (Arabic: Ÿ±ŸÑÿπÿ≤Ÿäÿ≤, "Great One", "Nobleman")[28] in the Qur'an, or Potiphar in the Bible.[29]  øAzƒ´z is also known as Qatafir or Qittin.[30] Joseph was taken into 'Aziz's home who told his wife to treat him well.

	Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well)...He said: "Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!" So they concealed him as a treasure. But Allah knoweth well all that they do.
	The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!
	The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: "Make his stay (among us) honourable: maybe he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.
	When Joseph attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.
	Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 19-22[31]

This is the point of the story that many scholars of Islam report as being central (contrasting to other religious traditions) to Joseph's story. Under  øAzƒ´z Misr (Arabic: ÿπÿ≤Ÿäÿ≤ ŸÖÿµÿ±, "The Dear One of Egypt"), Joseph moves to a high position in his household. Later, the brothers would come to Egypt but would not recognize Joseph but called him by the same title, "al- øAzƒ´z."[32]

While working for 'Aziz, Joseph grew to be a man. He was constantly approached by the wife of 'Aziz (Imra'at al-'Aziz, presumably Zulayka or Zuleika) (variations include 'Zulaykhah' and 'Zulaikhah' as well) who intended to seduce him. Tabari and others are not reticent to point out that Joseph was mutually attracted to her. ·π¨abari writes that the reason he did not succumb to her was because when they were alone the "figure of Jacob appeared to him, standing in the house and biting his fingers ‚Ä¶" and warned Joseph not to become involved with her. ·π¨abari, again, says "God turned him away from his desire for evil by giving him a sign that he should not do it."[33] It is also said that after the death of  øAzƒ´z, Joseph married Zolay·∏µƒÅ.[32]

	But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: "Now come, thou (dear one)!" He said: "Allah forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!"
	And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.
	Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 23-24[34]

Zolay·∏µƒÅ is said to have then ripped the back of Joseph's shirt and they raced with one another to the door where her husband was waiting. At that point she attempted to blame Joseph and suggested that he had attacked her. However, Joseph said that it was Zolay·∏µƒÅ who had attempted to seduce him and his account is confirmed by one of the household. ' øAzƒ´z believed Joseph and told his wife to beg forgiveness."[35] One member of the family, it is disputed who (perhaps a cousin) told  øAzƒ´z to check the shirt. If it was torn in the front than Joseph was guilty and his wife innocent but if it was torn in the back, Joseph was innocent and his wife guilty. It was torn in the back so  øAzƒ´z reprimands his wife for lying.[36]

Zuleikha's circle of friends thought that she was becoming infatuated with Joseph and mocked her for being in love with a slave. She invited them to her home and gave them all apples, and knives to peel them with. She then had Joseph walk through and distract the women who cut themselves with the knives. Zuleikha then pointed out that she had to see Joseph every day.[36]

Joseph prayed to God and said that he would prefer prison to the things that Zolay·∏µƒÅ and her friends wanted. According to ·π¨abari, some time later, even though  øAzƒ´z knew that Joseph was innocent, he "grew disgusted with himself for having let Joseph go free ‚Ä¶ It seemed good to them to imprison him for a time."[37] It is possible that Zolay·∏µƒÅ had influence here, rebuking her husband for having her honor threatened.

The account of Joseph and the wife of 'Aziz is called "Yusuf and Zulaikha," and has been told and retold countless times in many languages. The Qur'anic account differs from the Biblical version in which Potiphar believes his wife and throws Joseph into prison.[38]

#### Joseph interprets dreams
This account refers to the interaction between Joseph and the ruler of Egypt. Unlike the references to the Pharaoh in the account of Musa, the account of Joseph refers to the Egyptian ruler as a malik (Arabic: ŸÖŸÑŸÉ, 'king'), not a fir'aun (Arabic: ŸÅÿ±ÿπŸàŸÜ, 'pharaoh'). After Joseph had been imprisoned for a few years, God granted him the ability to interpret dreams, a power that made him popular amongst the prisoners. One event concerns two royal servants who, prior to Joseph's imprisonment, had been thrown into the dungeon for attempting to poison the food of the king ‚Äì whose name is not given either in the Qur'an or the Bible ‚Äì and his family. Joseph asked them about the dreams they had, and one of them described that he saw himself pressing grapes into wine. The other said he had seen himself holding a basket of bread on his head and birds were eating from it. Joseph reminded the prisoners that his ability to interpret dreams was a favor from God based on his adherence to monotheism. Joseph then stated that one of the men (the one who dreamt of squeezing grapes for wine) would be released from the prison and serve the king, but warned that the other would be executed, and so was done in time.[39]

Joseph had asked the one whom he knew would be released (·π¨abari writes that his name was Nabu) to mention his case to the king. When asked about his time in prison, ·π¨abari reports that Muhammad said: "If Joseph had not said that‚Äîmeaning what he said (to Nabu)‚Äîhe would not have stayed in prison as long as he did because he sought deliverance from someone other than God."[40]

The king had a dream of seven fat cows being eaten by seven skinny ones and seven ears of corn being replaced with shriveled ones, and he was terrified. None of his advisors could interpret it. When the servant who was released from prison heard about it, he remembered Joseph from prison and persuaded the king to send him to Joseph so that he could return with an interpretation. Joseph told the servant that Egypt would face seven years of prosperity and then suffer seven years of famine and that the king should prepare for it so as to avoid great suffering.[41]

Scholars debate as to whether Joseph agreed to interpret the dream right away or if he declared that his name should be cleared in the house of  øAzƒ´z first. ·π¨abari notes that when the messenger came to Joseph and invited him to come to the king, Joseph replied "Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. My lord surely knows their guile."[42] Ibn Kathir agrees with ·π¨abari saying that Joseph sought "restitution for this in order that  øAzƒ´z might know that he was not false to him during his absence" and that Zolay·∏µƒÅ eventually confessed that nothing happened between them.[43] ·π¨abari inserts an interesting interaction between Joseph and the angel Gabriel in which Gabriel helps Joseph both gain his freedom and admit to his own desires.[40]

Joseph said, "What you cultivate during the next seven years, when the time of harvest comes, leave the grains in their spikes, except for what you eat. After that, seven years of drought will come, which will consume most of what you stored for them. After that, a year will come that brings relief for the people, and they will, once again, press juice." (Qur'an, 12:47-49) Joseph was brought to king and interpreted the dream.

When he became aware of Yusuf's innocence, the king said, "Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person." Then, when he spoke to him, he said: "Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted."" (Quran 12:54) Upon speaking with Yusuf, the king recognized his virtues, great ability, brilliance, good conduct and perfect mannerisms. Yusuf said, "Set me over the storehouses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge" (Quran 12:55). Thus Yusuf asked the king to appoint him as Minister of Finance.

Use of "king" versus "pharaoh"
In the Qur'an, the title of the Ruler of Egypt during the time of Joseph is specifically said to be "the King" (Arabic: al-Malik) whilst the Ruler of Egypt during the time of Moses is specifically said to be "Pharaoh" (Arabic: Firaun, though as a name without the definite article). This is interesting because according to historical sources, the title Pharaoh only began to be used to refer to the rulers of Egypt (starting with the rule of Thutmose III) in 1479 BCE - approximately 21 years after the prophet Joseph died.[44] But in the narration of Yusuf in the Bible, the titles King (Hebrew: Melekh) and Pharaoh are used interchangeably for the ruler of Egypt in Genesis chapters 39-41.[45]

	The Malik (of Egypt) said: "I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! expound to me my vision, if it be that ye can interpret visions."
	Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf), Ayah 43,[46]

	Then after them We sent Musa with Our Signs to Fir'aun and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. So see how was the end of al-Mufsidin (Arabic: ÿ£ŸÑŸÖŸÅÿ≥ÿØŸäŸÜ, "the Mischief-makers" or "the Corrupters").
	Qur'an, Surah 7 (Al-Araf), Ayah 103 [47]

	And the Malik said: "Bring him to me." But when the messenger came to him, He (Yusuf) said: "Return to your lord and ask him, 'What happened to the women who cut their hands? Surely, my Lord (Allah) is Well-Aware of their plot.
	Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf), Ayah 50,[48]

	And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound; and he was there in the prison.
	Genesis 39:20

	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt.--And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
	Genesis 41:46

	And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
	Genesis 47:11

#### The family reunion
Joseph became extremely powerful. Ibn Kathir relates that the king of Egypt had faith in Joseph and that the people loved and revered him. It is said that Joseph was 30 when he was summoned to the king. "The king addressed him in 70 languages, and each time Joseph answered him in that language."[43] Ibn Is-haq comments, "the king of Egypt converted to Islam at the hands of Joseph."[41]

Joseph's brothers, in the meantime, had suffered while the people of Egypt prospered under Joseph's guidance. Jacob and his family were hungry and the brothers went to Egypt, unaware that Joseph was there and in such a high position.[49] Joseph gave them what they needed but questions them and they reveal that there were once twelve of them. They lie and say that the one most loved by their father, meaning Joseph, died in the desert. Joseph tells them to bring Benjamin, the youngest, to him. They return home to Jacob and persuade him to let Benjamin accompany them in order to secure food. Jacob insists that they bring Benjamin back‚Äîand this time the brothers are honest when they swear to it.[50] According to Ibn Kathir, Jacob ordered the brothers to use many gates when returning to Egypt because they were all handsome.[51] The Qur æƒÅn itself elaborates that Jacob sensed Joseph.

When the brothers return with Benjamin, Joseph reveals himself to Benjamin. He then gives the brothers the supplies he promised but also put the king's cup into one of the bags. He then proceeds to accuse them of stealing, which the brothers deny. Joseph informs them that whoever it was who stole the cup will be enslaved to the owner and the brothers agree, not realizing the plot against them. ·π¨abari reports that the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.[52]

After much discussion and anger, the brothers try to get Benjamin released by offering themselves instead‚Äîfor they must keep their promise to their father. Reuben stays behind with Benjamin in order to keep his promise to his father. When the other brothers inform Jacob of what has happened, Jacob does not believe them and becomes blind after crying much over the disappearance of his son. Forty years had passed since Joseph was taken from his father, and Jacob had held it in his heart. Jacob sends the brothers back to find out about Benjamin and Joseph. Upon their return Joseph reveals himself to his brothers and gives them one of his shirts to give to Jacob.[53]

When Jacob receives the shirt, this time as good news, Jacob lays it on his face and regains his vision. He says `Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know?` (12:96). ·π¨abari says that this means that "from the truth of the interpretation of Joseph's dream in which he saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon bowing down to him, he knew that which they did not know."[54]

Joseph was reunited with his family, and his dream as a child came true as he saw his parents and eleven of his brothers prostrating before him in love, welcome and respect. Ibn Kathir mentions that his mother had already died but there are some who argue that she came back to life.[55] ·π¨abari says that she was alive. Joseph eventually died in Egypt. Tradition holds that when Musa (Moses) left Egypt, he took Joseph's coffin with him so that he would be buried alongside his ancestors in Canaan.[55]

#### Death and burial
It is hard to find sources that consistently agree on the actual dates of Joseph's life. Scholars tend to see the story as a way for the descendants of Abraham to find their way to Egypt. Joseph is the reason the Israelites move to Egypt, which then allows for the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt to take place.

Historically, some Muslims also associated Joseph's Tomb with that of the biblical figure[citation needed]. In recent years however, they[by whom?] claim that an Islamic cleric, Sheikh Yussuf (Joseph) Dawiqat, was buried there two centuries ago.[56] According to Islamic tradition, the biblical Joseph is buried in Hebron, next to the Cave of the Patriarchs where a medieval structure known as Yussuf-Kalah, the "Castle of Joseph", is located.

	<summary>Ayyub (Job)</summary>

Ayyub came after Yusuf. The Quran describes Job as a righteous servant of Allah, who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Job never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer, asking Him to remove his affliction:
And [mention] Job, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful." ‚Äî‚ÄâQuran, sura 21 (The Prophets), ayah 83

The narrative goes on to state that after many years of suffering, God ordered Job to "Strike with thy foot!".[6] At once, Job struck the ground with his foot and God caused a cool spring of water to gush forth from the Earth, from which Job could replenish himself. The Quran states that it was then that God removed his pain and suffering and He returned Job's family to him, blessed him with many generations of children and granted him great wealth. In addition to the brief descriptions of Job's narrative, the Quran further mentions Job twice in the lists of those whom God had given special guidance, wisdom and inspiration (IV: 163) and as one of the men who received authority, the gift of prophethood (VI:84).

After Satan has given up trying to turn Job away from the Lord, God removed Job's affliction and returned his family to him, doubling them in number. He returned Job's wealth and showered Job with gold. Once Job's wife had seen her husband restored to prosperity and health, she prayed thanks to God but then worried over the oath her husband had taken earlier, in which he had promised to beat her with a hundred strokes. Job was also deeply grieved over the oath he had taken, amidst his suffering. God, however, sent a revelation to Job, which told him to not beat his wife but to gently hit her with a bundle of soft grass.

	<summary>Shu'ayb (Jethro?)</summary>

The Qur'an states that Shuaib was appointed by God to be a prophet to the people of Midian. The people of this land were said to be especially notorious for cheating others through dishonesty and for idolatry. Shu øayb's prophecy mainly involved calling the Midianites to the correct path of God, and forbidding them to worship false gods.

It is also said he told his people to stop being dishonest in their daily activities. Although he preached and prophesied for a sustained period of time, the majority of the people refused to listen to him. Shuayb, however, remained steadfast. He consistently preached powerfully against the wicked, telling them of the punishment that had befallen the sinful before them. Shu øayb warned the people that their ignorance would lead to the destruction of Midian, giving historical examples of earlier prophets, including Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot, all of whose people had been destroyed by God.

The people taunted Shu øayb and told him that, were it not for the prestigious family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuayb replied, "Is my family of more consideration with you than God?" When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur'an, however, mentions that Shu øayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment.

## 5. Musa and the Exodus
*******************************************
Five Books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy)
<details>
<summary><b>Musa (Moses) üåø üî• </b></summary> 
In Islam, M≈´sƒÅ ben  øEmrƒÅn[1] (Arabic: ŸÖŸàÿ≥€å ÿ®ŸÜ ÿπŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÜ, lit.‚Äâ'Moses, son of Imran'Amram'Am), is an important prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and is the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran, with his name being mentioned 136 times and his life being narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet.[2][3]

According to Islamic theology, all Muslims must have faith in every prophet and messenger of God, which includes Musa and his brother Harun. The tale of Musa is generally seen as a spiritual parallel to the life of Muhammad, and Muslims consider many aspects of the two individuals' lives to be shared.[4] Islamic literature also describes a parallel relation between their people and the incidents that occurred in their lifetimes; the exodus of the Israelites from ancient Egypt is considered to be similar in nature to the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina as both events unfolded in the face of persecution‚Äîof the Israelites by the ancient Egyptians, and of the early Muslims by the Meccans, respectively.[5]

Musa is also viewed as a very important figure in Islam due to his reception of revelations such as the Ten Commandments, which form part of the contents of the Torah and are central to the Abrahamic religions of Judaism and Christianity.[6][7] Consequently, Jews and Christians are designated as "People of the Book" for Muslims and are to be recognized with this special status wherever Islamic law is applied. According to Islamic tradition, Musa is one of the many prophets that meets Muhammad in the seven heavens following the latter's ascension from Jerusalem during the Mi øraj.[8] During the journey, Musa is said to have repeatedly sent Muhammad back to meet God and request a reduction in the number of required daily prayers‚Äîoriginally 50‚Äîuntil only the five obligatory prayers remained.[9][10] Musa is further revered in Islamic literature, which expands upon the incidents of his life and the miracles attributed to him in the Quran and hadith, such as his direct conversations with God.

#### Childhood
According to Islamic tradition, Musa was born into a family of Israelites living in Egypt. Of his family, Islamic tradition generally names his father 'Imran, corresponding to the Amram of the Hebrew Bible, traditional genealogies name Levi as his ancestor.[11] Islam states that Musa was born in a time when the ruling Pharaoh had enslaved the Israelites after the time of the prophet Yusuf (Joseph). Islamic literature states that around the time of Musa's birth, the Pharaoh has a dream in which he sees fire coming from the city of Jerusalem, which burns everything in his kingdom except in the land of the Israelites. (Other stories says that the Pharaoh dreams of a little boy who catches the Pharaoh's crown and destroys it,[12] although there is no authentic Islamic reference to whether the dreams actually occurred.) When the Pharaoh is informed that one of the male children would grow up to overthrow him, he orders the killing of all newborn Israelite males in order to prevent the prediction from occurring.[13] Experts of economics in Pharaoh's court advise him that killing the male infants of the Israelites would result in loss of manpower.[14] Therefore, they suggest that male infants should be killed in one year but spared the next.[14] Musa's brother, Harun, was born in the year when infants were spared, while Musa was born in the year when infants were to be killed.[15]

#### On the Nile

Asiya (depicted with long black tresses) and her servants, having finished bathing, find baby Musa in the Nile. Their clothes hang in the trees while the river waves and crests are done in the Chinese style. Illustration from the Persian Jami' al-tawarikh
According to Islamic tradition, Jochebed, Musa's mother, suckles him secretly during this period. When they are in danger of being caught, God inspires her to put him in a wicker basket and set him adrift on the Nile.[16] She instructs her daughter to follow the course of the ark and report back to her. As her daughter follows the ark along the riverbank, Musa is discovered by the Pharaoh's wife, Asiya, who convinces the Pharaoh to adopt him.[17][18] When Asiya ordered wet nurses for Musa, Musa refuses to be breastfed. Islamic tradition states that this is because God forbids Musa from being fed by any wet nurse in order to reunite him with his mother.[19] His sister worries that Musa has not been fed for some time, so she appears to the Pharaoh and informs him that she knows someone who can feed him.[20] After being questioned, she is ordered to bring the woman being discussed.[20] The sister brings their mother, who feeds Musa, and thereafter, she is appointed as the wet nurse of Musa.[21]

#### Test of prophecy
According to Isra'iliyat hadith, when Musa is playing on the Pharaoh's lap in his childhood, he grabs the Pharaoh's beard and slaps him in the face. This action prompts the Pharaoh to consider Musa as the Israelite who would overthrow him, and the Pharaoh wants to kill Musa. The Pharaoh's wife persuades him not to kill him because he is an infant. Instead, he decides to test Musa.[22] Two plates are set before young Musa, one containing rubies and the other glowing coals.[22] Musa reaches out for the rubies, but the angel Gabriel directs his hand to the coals. Musa grabs a glowing coal and puts it in his mouth, burning his tongue.[23] After the incident, Musa suffers a speech defect, but is spared by the Pharaoh.[24][25]

#### Escape to Midian

The Midian Mountains near Haql on the coast of the Gulf of Aqaba, which separates Midian in the northern part of the Arabian Peninsula and Ash-Shaam from the Sinai Peninsula in present-day Egypt
After having reached adulthood, according to the Quran, Musa is passing through a city when he comes across an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite. The Israelite man is believed to be Sam'ana, known in the bible to be a Samaritan, who asks Musa for his assistance against the Egyptian who is mistreating him. Musa attempts to intervene and becomes involved in the dispute.[26][self-published source] Musa strikes the Egyptian in a state of anger, which results in his death.[27] Musa then repents to God, and the following day, he again comes across the same Israelite fighting with another Egyptian. The Israelite again asks Musa for help, and as Musa approaches the Israelite, he reminds Musa of his manslaughter and asks if Musa intended to kill the Egyptian. Musa is reported, and the Pharaoh orders Musa to be killed. However, Musa flees to the desert after being alerted to his punishment.[13] According to Islamic tradition, after Musa arrives in Midian, he witnesses two female shepherds driving back their flocks from a well.[28] Musa approaches them and inquires about their work as shepherds and their retreat from the well. Upon hearing their answers and about the old age of their father, Shuaib, Musa waters their flocks for them.[28] The two shepherds return to their home and inform their father of Musa. They then invite Musa to a feast. At that feast, their father asks Musa to work for him for a period of eight years in return for marriage to one of his daughters.[26] Musa consents and works for him for ten years.[26]

##### Preaching
###### Call to prophethood

This is believed[by whom?] to be the Biblical Mount Sinai, where Musa first spoke to God.
According to the Quran, Musa departs for Egypt along with his family after completing the contracted time period. During their travel, as they stop near Tur, Musa observes a large fire and instructs the family to wait until he returns with fire for them. When Musa reaches the Valley of Tuwa, God calls out to him from the right side of the valley from a tree, on what is revered as Al-Buq‚Äòah Al-MubƒÅrakah ("The Blessed Ground") in the Quran.[29] Musa is commanded by God to remove his shoes and is informed of his selection as a prophet, his obligation of prayer and the Day of Judgment. Musa is then ordered to throw his rod, which turns into a snake, and later instructed to hold it.[30] The Quran then narrates Musa being ordered to insert his hand into his clothes and when he revealed it, it shines a bright light.[31] God states that these are signs for the Pharaoh, and orders Musa to invite Pharaoh to the worship of one God.[31] Musa expresses his fear of Pharaoh and requests God to heal his speech impediment and grant him Harun as a helper. According to Islamic tradition, both of them state their fear of Pharaoh, but are assured by God that He would be observing them and commands them to inform the Pharaoh to free the Israelites. Therefore, they depart to preach to the Pharaoh.[28]

The Quran states that Musa was sent by God to confront the erstwhile (pharaoh) of ancient Egypt and to guide the Israelites, who were enslaved by the former. The Quran directly validates Musa and Harun as prophets chosen by God:

	And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet. And We called him from the side of the mount at [his] right and brought him near, confiding [to him]. And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Harun as a prophet.
	Quran 19:51‚Äì53[32]

##### Arrival at Pharaoh's court
When Musa and Harun arrive in the court of Pharaoh and proclaim their prophethood to the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh begins questioning Musa about the God he follows. The Quran narrates that Musa answers the Pharaoh by stating that he follows the God who gives everything its form and guides them.[33] The Pharaoh then inquires about the generations who passed before them, and Musa answers that knowledge of the previous generations is with God.[34] The Quran also mentions the Pharaoh questioning Musa: ‚ÄúAnd what is the Lord of the worlds?‚Äù[35] Musa replies that God is the lord of the heavens, the earth and what is between them. The Pharaoh then reminds Musa of his childhood with them and the killing of the man he has done.[36] Musa admits that he has committed the deed in ignorance, but insists that he is now forgiven and guided by God. Pharaoh accuses him of being mad and threatens to imprison him if he continues to proclaim that the Pharaoh is not the true god. Musa informs him that he has come with manifest signs from God.[37] When the Pharaoh demands to see the signs, Musa throws his staff to the floor, and it turns into a serpent.[38] He then draws out his hand, and it shines a bright white light. The Pharaoh's counselors advises him that this is sorcery, and on their advice he summons the best sorcerers in the kingdom. The Pharaoh challenges Musa to a battle between him and the Pharaoh's magicians, asking him to choose the day. Musa chose the day of a festival.

##### Confrontation with sorcerers

Pharaoh watches a serpent devour a demon in the presence of Musa; from a manuscript of Qisas al-Anbiya, c. 1540.
When the sorcerers come to the Pharaoh, he promises them that they would be among the honored among his assembly if they won. On the day of the festival of Egypt, Musa grants the sorcerers the chance to perform first and warned them that God would expose their tricks. The Quran states that the sorcerers bewitch the eyes of the observers and cause them terror.[39][self-published source] The summoned sorcerers throw their rods on the floor, and they appear to change into snakes by the effect of their magic. At first, Musa becomes concerned witnessing the tricks of the magicians, but is assured by God to not be worried. When Musa does the same his rod, the serpent devours all the sorcerers' snakes.[40] The sorcerers realize that they have witnessed a miracle. They proclaim belief in the message of Musa and fall onto their knees in prostration despite threats from the Pharaoh.[citation needed] The Pharaoh is enraged by this and accuses them of working under Musa. He warns them that if they insist in believing in Musa, he would cut their hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify them on the trunks of palm trees for their betrayal of the Pharaoh. The magicians, however, remain steadfast to their newfound faith and are punished by Pharaoh.[41]

<summary><b>Exodus</b></summary>

#### Exodus
##### Plagues of Egypt
After losing against Musa, the Pharaoh continues to plan against Musa and the Israelites, ordering meetings with the ministers, princes and priests. According to the Quran, the Pharaoh is reported to have ordered his minister, Haman, to build a tower so that he "may look at the God of Musa".[42] Gradually, the Pharaoh begins to fear that Musa may convince the people that he is not the true god, and wants to have Musa killed. After this threat, a man from the family of Pharaoh, who had years ago warned Musa, comes forth and warns the people of the punishment of God for the wrongdoers and reward for the righteous. The Pharaoh defiantly refuses to allow the Israelites to leave Egypt. The Quran states that God decrees punishments over him and his people. These punishments come in the form of floods that demolish their dwellings, swarms of locust that destroy the crops,[43] pestilence of lice that makes their life miserable,[44] toads that croak and spring everywhere, and the turning of all drinking water into blood. Each time the Pharaoh is subjected to humiliation, his defiance becomes greater. The Quran mentions that God instructs Musa to travel at night with the Israelites and warns them that they would be pursued. The Pharaoh chases the Israelites with his army after realizing that they have left during the night.[45]

##### Splitting of the sea
Having escaped and now being pursued by the Egyptians, the Israelites stop when they reach the seafront. The Israelites exclaim to Musa that they would be overtaken by Pharaoh and his army. In response, God commands Musa to strike the Red Sea with his staff, instructing them not to fear being inundated or drowning in sea water. Upon striking the sea, Musa splits it into two parts, forming a path that allows the Israelites to pass through. The Pharaoh witnesses the sea splitting alongside his army, but as they also try to pass through, the sea closes in on them.[46][47] As he is about to die, Pharaoh proclaims belief in the God of Musa and the Israelites, but his belief is rejected by God.[48] The Quran states that the body of the Pharaoh is made a sign and warning for all future generations. As the Israelites continue their journey to the Promised Land, they come upon people who are worshipping idols. The Israelites request to have an idol to worship, but Musa refuses and states that the polytheists would be destroyed by God.[49] They are granted manna and quail as sustenance from God, but the Israelites ask Musa to pray to God for the earth to grow lentils, onions, herbs and cucumbers for their sustenance.[50] When they stop in their travel to the Promised Land due to lack of water, Musa is commanded by God to strike a stone, and upon its impact twelve springs came forth, each for a specific tribe of the Israelites.[51]

<summary><b>The Torah </b></summary>

#### Years in the wilderness
##### Revelation of the Torah

The revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai as depicted in Biblical illustrations
After leaving Egypt, Musa leads the Israelites to Mount Sinai (Tur). Upon arrival, Musa leaves the people, instructing them that Harun is to be their leader during his absence. Musa is commanded by God to fast for thirty days and to then proceed to the valley of Tuwa for guidance. God orders Musa to fast again for ten days before returning. After completing his fasts, Musa returns to the spot where he had first received his miracles from God. He takes off his shoes as before and goes down into prostration. Musa prays to God for guidance and begs God to reveal himself to him.[52] It is narrated in the Quran that God tells him that it would not be possible for Musa to perceive God, but that He would reveal himself to the mountain, stating: "By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me." When God reveals himself to the mountain, it instantaneously turns into ashes, and Musa loses consciousness. When he recovers, he goes down in total submission and asks forgiveness of God.[53]

Musa is then given the Ten Commandments by God as Guidance and as Mercy. Meanwhile, in his absence, a man named Samiri creates a Golden Calf, proclaiming it to be the God of Musa.[54] The people begin to worship it. Harun attempts to guide them away from the Golden Calf, but the Israelites refuse to do so until Musa returns. Musa, having thus received the scriptures for his people, is informed by God that the Israelites has been tested in his absence, and they have gone astray by worshiping the Golden Calf. Musa comes down from the mountain and returns to his people.[55] The Quran states that Musa, in his anger, grabs hold of Harun by his beard and admonishes him for doing nothing to stop them, but when Harun tells Musa of his fruitless attempt to stop them, Musa understands his helplessness, and they both pray to God for forgiveness. Musa then questions Samiri for creating the Golden Calf. Samiri replies that it had simply occurred to him, and he had done so.[56] Samiri is exiled, and the Golden Calf is burned to ashes, and the ashes are thrown into the sea. The wrong-doers who have worshipped the Calf are ordered to be punished for their crime.[57]

Musa then chooses 70 elites from among the Israelites and orders them to pray for forgiveness. Shortly thereafter, the elders travel alongside Musa to witness the speech between Musa and God. Despite witnessing the speech between them, they refuse to believe until they see God with their own eyes, so as punishment, a thunderbolt kills them. Musa prays for their forgiveness, and they are resurrected. They return to camp and set up a tent dedicated to worshiping God, as Harun had taught them from the Torah. They resume their journey towards the Promised Land.

##### The Israelites and the cow
Islamic exegesis narrates the incident of an old and pious man who lives among the Israelites and earns his living honestly. As he is dying, he places his wife, his little son, and his only possession‚Äîa calf in God's care‚Äîinstructing his wife to take the calf and leave it in a forest.[58] His wife does as she is told, and after a few years, when the son has grown up, she informs him about the calf. The son travels to the forest with a rope.[59] He prostrates and prays to God to return the calf to him. As the son prays, the now-grown cow stops beside him. The son takes the cow with him. The son is also pious and earns his living as a lumberjack.

One wealthy man among the Israelites dies and leaves his wealth to his son. The relatives of the wealthy son secretly murders the son in order to inherit his wealth. The other relatives of the son come to Musa and ask for his help in tracing the killers. Musa instructs them to slaughter a cow, cut out its tongue, and then place it on the corpse; this would reveal the killers.[60] The relatives do not believe Musa and do not understand why they are instructed to slaughter a cow when they are trying to find the killers. They accuse Musa of joking, but Musa manages to convince them that he is serious. Hoping to delay the process, the relatives ask the type and age of the cow they should slaughter, but Musa tells them that it is neither old nor young but in-between the two ages.[61] Instead of searching for the cow described, they inquire about its colour, to which Musa replies that it is yellow.[62] They ask Musa for more details, and he informs them that it is unyoked, and does not plow the soil nor does it water the tilth. The relatives and Musa search for the described cow, but the only cow that they find to fit the description belongs to an orphaned youth.[63] The youth refuses to sell the cow without consulting his mother. All of them travel together to the youth's home. The mother refuses to sell the cow, despite the relatives constantly increasing the price. They urge the orphaned son to tell his mother to be more reasonable. However, the son refuse to sell the cow without his mother's agreement, claiming that he would not sell it even if they offered to fill its skin with gold. At this, the mother agrees to sell it for its skin filled with gold. The relatives and Musa consent, and the cow is slaughtered and the corpse is touched by its tongue.[64] The corpse rises back to life and reveals the identity of the killers.

#### Other incidents
The sayings of Muhammad (hadith), Islamic literature and Quranic exegesis also narrate some incidents of the life of Musa. One story goes that he is bathing apart from the other Israelites who all bathe together. This leads the Bani Israels to say that Musa does so due to a scrotal hernia. One day, when Musa is bathing in seclusion, he puts his clothes on a stone, and the stone flees with his clothes. Musa rushes after the stone, and when the Bani Israels see him, they say, 'By Allah, Musa has got no defect in his body". Musa then beats the stone with his clothes, and Abu Huraira states, "By Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone from that excessive beating".[70] In a hadith, Muhammad states that the stone still has three to five marks due to Musa hitting it.[70]

#### Death

Harun dies shortly before Musa. It is reported in a Sunni hadith that when Azrael, the Angel of Death, comes to Musa, Musa slaps him in the eye. The angel returns to God and tells Him that Musa does not want to die.[71] God tells the angel to return and tell Musa to put his hand on the back of an ox, and for every hair that comes under his hand, he would be granted a year of life. When Musa asks God what would happen after the granted time, God informs him that he would die after the period. Musa, therefore, requests God for death at his current age near the Promised Land "at a distance of a stone's throw from it."[72]

<summary><b>Meeting with Khidr </b></summary>

#### Meeting with Khidr
One hadith recounts that when Musa is delivering an impressive sermon, an Israelite inquires if there were anyone more knowledgeable than him.[65] When Musa denies any such person exists, he receives a revelation from God, which admonishes Musa for not attributing absolute knowledge to God and informs Musa that there is someone named Khidr who is more knowledgeable than him.[65] Upon inquiry, God informs Musa that Khidr would be found at the junction of two seas. God instructs Musa to take a live fish and at the location where it would escape, Khidr would be found.[65] Afterwards, Musa departs and travels alongside with a boy named Yusha (Yeshua bin Nun), until they stop near a rock where Musa rests. While Musa is asleep, the fish escapes from the basket. When Musa wakes up, they continue until they stop for eating. At that moment, Yusha remembers that the fish had slipped from the basket at the rock. He informs Musa about the fish, and Musa remembers God's statement, so they retrace their steps back to the rock. There they see Khidr. Musa approaches Khidr and greets him. Khidr instead asks Musa how people are greeted in their land. Musa introduces himself, and Khidr identifies him as the prophet of the Israelites. According to the Quran, Musa asks Khidr: "Shall I closely follow you on condition that you teach me of what you have been taught?"[66] Khidr warns that he would not be able to remain patient and consents on the condition that Musa would not question his actions.[65]

They walk on the seashore and pass by a ship. The crew of the ship recognize Khidr and offer them to board their ship free of charge. When they are on the boat, Khidr takes an adze and pulls up a plank.[67] When Musa notices what Khidr is doing, he is astonished and stops him. Musa reminds Khidr that the crew has taken them aboard for free. Khidr admonishes Musa for forgetting his promise of not asking. Musa states that he has forgotten and asks to be forgiven. When they leave the seashore, they pass by a boy playing with others. Khidr takes hold of the boy's head and kills him.[67] Musa is again astonished by this action and questions Khidr regarding what he had done.[68] Khidr admonishes Musa again for not keeping his promise, and Musa apologizes and asks Khidr to leave him if he again questions Khidr. Both of them travel on until they happened upon a village. They ask the villagers for food, but the inhabitants refuse to entertain them as guests. They see therein a wall which is about to collapse, and Khidr repairs the wall. Musa asks Khidr why he had repaired the wall when the inhabitants refuse to entertain them as guests and give them food. Musa states that Khidr could have taken wages for his work.

Khidr informs Musa that they are now to part ways as Musa has broken his promise. Khidr then explains each of his actions. He informs Musa that he had broken the ship with the adze because a ruler who reigns in those parts took all functional ships by force; Khidr has created a defect in order to prevent their ship from being taken by force.[68] Khidr then explains that he has killed the child because he was mischievous and disobedient to his parents, and Khidr fears that the child would overburden them with his disobedience, and explained that God would replace him with a better one who is more obedient and has more affection. Khidr then explains that he has fixed the wall because it belongs to two hapless children whose father is pious. God wishes to reward them for their piety. Khidr states that there is a treasure hidden underneath the wall, and by repairing the wall, the wall would break in the future, and when dealing with the broken wall, the orphans would find the treasure.[69]

## 6. Jewish Kings and Prophets
*******************************************

<details>
<summary><b>Davud </b></summary>
Dawud (Arabic: ÿØŸéÿßŸàŸèŸàŸíÿØ, romanized: DƒÅw≈´d [daÀêwuÀêd]), is a prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and is righteous, divinely-anointed monarch of the United Kingdom of Israel.[1] Additionally, Muslims also honor David for having received the divine revelation of the Zabur (Psalms).[2][3] Mentioned sixteen times in the Quran, David appears in the Islamic scripture as a link in the chain of prophets who preceded Muhammad.[4] Although he is not usually considered one of the "law-giving" prophets (ul≈´ al- øazm), "he is far from a marginal figure" in Islamic thought.[2] In later Islamic traditions, he is praised for his rigor in prayer and fasting. He is also presented as the prototypical just ruler and as a symbol of God's authority on earth, having been at once a king and a prophet.

David is particularly important to the religious architecture of Islamic Jerusalem.[1] Dawud is known as biblical David who was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah, reigning c.‚Äâ1010‚Äì970 BCE

#### Narrative in the Quran
David's narrative in the Quran, in many respects, parallels that given in the Bible. He is named a prophet (nabƒ´) and also a messenger (ras≈´l), David is included in lists of those who received revelation (wa·∏•y; Q4:163) or guidance (hudƒÅ; 6:84) from God. In both lists his name appears next to that of his son Solomon. Elsewhere, the Quran explains that God gave to both of them the gifts of "sound judgment" (·∏•ukm; 21:79) and "knowledge" ( øilm; 21:79; 27:15). Yet the Quran also ascribes to David merits that distinguish him from Solomon: David killed Goliath (2:251) and received a divine revelation named "the Psalms"[6] 
(Quran 17:55 uses an indefinite form, while 21:105 uses the definite form al-Zab≈´r),[6] presumably a reference to the Psalms or the Psalter (the term Zab≈´r is perhaps related to the Hebrew term mizm≈çr or Syriac mazm≈´rƒÅ, "psalm"). The mountains and the birds praised God along with David (21:79; in 34:10 God commands them to do so; cfr. Psalm 148:7‚Äì10). God made David a "vicegerent" (khalƒ´fa; 38:26), a title that the Quran otherwise gives only to Adam (2:30). This title suggests that, according to the Quran, David was something more than a messenger: he was a divinely guided leader who established God's rule on Earth.[1] This role is also suggested by 2:251: "God gave him authority (mulk) and wisdom (·∏•ikmah) and taught him what He willed. If God did not drive back some people by others, the earth would become corrupt."[2]

Among the things taught to David was the ability to make armour (21:80, 34:10‚Äì11), a suggestion that David‚Äôs military exploits were the act of God. It is also important that the Quranic reference to David's "wisdom" was sometimes explained by the classical exegetes as the gift of prophecy.[7] The Quran also connects David and Jesus, by insisting that both cursed those Israelites who did not believe (5:78). Moreover, according to the Quran, David was given the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood when dispensing justice (fa·π£l al-khi·π≠ƒÅb, 38:20). Furthermore, there is the allusion to a test David was put through, wherein he prayed and repented and God forgave him (38:24-5). Surat Sad (the 38th chapter of the Quran) is also called "the s≈´ra of David"[8] Exegetes explain that since David prostrated when asking God to forgive him, Muhammad was ordered to imitate him and to perform a prostration when reading this chapter.[9]

Religious significance
David is one of the few Islamic Prophets who received Kingship as well. While other prophets preached during the reign of kings, David, in his time, was the king. Thus, he received an extremely large task, of making sure that the people of Israel were not only held in check spiritually but that the country itself remained strong as well. His place as both leader and prophet is revered by all Muslims as one of extremely high rank. The figure of David, together with that of his prophetic son, Solomon, are iconic of people who ruled justly over their land. God frequently mentions David's high rank as a prophet and messenger in the Quran. He is often mentioned alongside other prophets to emphasize how great he was. For example, God says:

	And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus We reward those who are upright and do good.
	Quran 6:84

When the Caliph 'Umar visited Jerusalem, the Patriarch Sophronius accompanied him on the Temple Mount, while he searched for the Mihrab Dawud (David's prayer-niche) to perform a prayer. Later commentators identified this site with the Tower of David. In a hadith, the prayer and fasting of David is mentioned to be dear to God.

Narrated Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As: The Apostle of Allah told me, "The most beloved prayer to Allah is that of David and the most beloved fasts to Allah are those of David. He used to sleep for half of the night and then pray for one third of the night and again sleep for its sixth part and used to fast on alternate days."
‚Äî‚ÄâMuhammad al-Bukhari, Sahih al-Bukhari[11]

#### The Book of David: Zabur

The Zabur is the holy book attributed to David by God, just as Musa (Moses) received the Tawrat (Torah), Isa (Jesus) received the Injil (Gospel) and Muhammad received the Quran. In the current Hebrew Bible, the Zabur is known as the Psalms. However, like other scriptures of the past, the Psalms are believed to have been corrupted over time, with some of the original message now gone. Nonetheless, Muslims are told to treat the present Psalms with immense respect because, in their original form, they too were an inspired Book of God. The Quran states:

	Your Lord knows whoever is in the heavens and the earth. We exalted some of the prophets over the others; and to David We gave the Book of Psalms.
	Quran 17:55[12]

The term Zabur is the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew Zimra, meaning "song/music." It, along with Zamir ("song") and Mizmor ("Psalm"), is a derivative of Zamar, meaning "sing", "sing praise", "make music". Thus, David is also usually attributed the gifts of music and song.

#### David in the Bible

This was after Samson.
The current King Saul declared war on Philistine. David was a shepherd. 
Saul hires David to play him music. Philistines send Goliaf with the army against israelites. David declares that he will beat the giant and kills the giant with one shot of his sling. 
David was successful in the wars and his popularit grows. Saul grows jealous. David flees to Moab and then lives in caves of Ziph. Saul searches him to kill him. .
Saul then ceases to kill David.
philistines kill Saul. David becomes the king of Israel. David conquers Jerusalem.

<summary><b>Sulayman (Solomon) </b></summary>
SulaimƒÅn ibn DƒÅw≈´d (Arabic: ÿ≥ŸèŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜ ÿ®ŸíŸÜ ÿØŸéÿßŸàŸèŸàŸíÿØ, Solomon son of David) was, according to the Quran, a malik (ŸÖŸéŸÑŸêŸÉ, king) and Nabƒ´ (Prophet) of the Israelites. Islamic tradition generally holds that he was the third king of Jewish people, and a wise ruler for the nation.

Islam views Solomon as one of the prophets of God, who was bestowed with many God-given gifts, including the ability to speak to animals and jinn. Supported by a magical ring given by God, he enslaved the devils (shayatin) and demons (div).

Muslims further maintain that he remained faithful to the one and only God throughout his life; and reigned justly over the whole of the Israelites; was blessed with a level of kingship which was given to none after him and before him; and fulfilled all of his commandments, being promised nearness to God in Paradise at the end of his life. Arab historians regarded Solomon as one of the greatest rulers around the world.

**Judgment on the field**

In the earliest narrative involving Solomon, the Quran (21:78) briefly alludes to a story that Solomon was in the company of his father, when two men came to ask David to judge between them regarding a ·∏•arth (ÿ≠Ÿéÿ±Ÿíÿ´, field). Later Muslim commentators expanded on the allusion, including Al-Tabari, Baidawi, and Ibn Kathir. They said that the first of the two men said that he owned a vineyard of which he took great care the whole year through. But one day, when he was absent, the other man's sheep had strayed into the vineyard and devoured the grapes. He asked to be compensated for this damage.[9]:‚Ää62‚Ää Upon hearing the man's complaint, Solomon suggested that the owner of the sheep take the other man's vineyard to repair and cultivate until the vines returned to their former state, whereupon he should return it to its owner. At the same time, the owner of the vineyard would care for the sheep and benefit from their wool and milk until his land was returned to him, at which point he would return the sheep to their owner. Solomon's level of judgment, which the Quran says,[10] would characterize Solomon throughout his life. ·∏§ikmah (Wisdom), according to Muslim tradition, would always be associated with Solomon, who would later even be referred to as SulaimƒÅn al-·∏§akƒ´m (ÿ≥ŸèŸÑŸéŸäŸíŸÖŸéÿßŸÜ Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ≠ŸéŸÉŸêŸäŸíŸÖ, "Solomon the Wise"). This story is adapted in the Kebra Nagast, but as a dispute adjudicated by a son of Solomon's.

**Solomon and the demons**

The Queen of Sheba
The Quran narrates that the wind was made subservient to Solomon, and he could control it at his own will, and that the jinn also came under Solomon's control. The jinn helped strengthen Solomon's reign. The devils (shayatin), and demons were forced building for him monuments. God also caused a miraculous  øayn (ÿπŸéŸäŸíŸÜ, 'fount' or 'spring') of molten qi·π≠r (ŸÇŸêÿ∑Ÿíÿ±, 'brass' or 'copper') to flow for Solomon, to be used by the demons in their construction.

When David died, Solomon inherited his position as the prophetic king of the Israelites. Solomon once permitted a woman to build a statue of her father. Later, she began to worship the statue and Solomon was rebuked for tolerating idolatry in his kingdom. As a punishment, God enabled one of the enslaved demons to steal Solomon's ring and take over his kingdom (Surah 38:34). He later repents his sin and gains control over the demons again, focusing on building the temple again. He prayed to God to grant him a kingdom which would be unlike any after him. God accepted Solomon's prayer and gave him what he pleased.

Allegorical, Solomon's loss to the demons, is a human losing its soul to demonic passion. Attar of Nishapur writes: "If you bind the div (demon), you will set out for the royal pavilion with Solomon" and "You have no command over your self's kingdom, for in your case the div is in the place of Solomon".

Unlike the Talmudic tradition, Solomon was unaware and never participated in idolatry. Further, the Quran rejects that Solomon was a magician: "(...) Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching men magic and (...)". (2:102)

**Solomon and the ant** üêú

Solomon was even taught the languages of various animals, such as ants. The Quran recounts that, one day, Solomon and his army entered a wƒÅdin-naml (ŸàŸéÿßÿØŸê Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÜŸéŸëŸÖŸíŸÑ, valley of the ant). On seeing Solomon and his army, a namlah (ŸÜŸéŸÖŸíŸÑŸéÿ©, female ant) warned all the others to `... get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it.` Immediately understanding what the ant said, Solomon, as always, prayed to God, thanking him for bestowing upon him such gifts and further avoided trampling over the ant colonies.[9]:‚Ää63 Solomon's wisdom, however, was yet another of the gifts he received from God, and Muslims maintain that Solomon never forgot his daily prayer, which was more important to him than any of his gifts.

Exegetical literature emphasizes the ant's wisdom and explains the meaning behind Solomon's gift to control the wind. According to Sirac√º'l-Kulub, the ant asks Solomon if he knows why he is called "Solomon" (S√ºleyman). Solomon negates and the ant went on to explain: "Although your heart was sound (selim) and you know the circumstances of the next world, you have accepted a few pleassures of this world and have been deceived by its possesion and kingship; therefore you are called Solomon." Afterwards the ant asks Solomon, if he knows why God has subdued the wind for him. Once again, Solomon denies and the ant answers: "He has subdued the wind for a reason: that which you have accepted is nothing. Just as the wind passes, the world's wealth and kingship pass too." Scholars like Fakhr al-Din Razi and al-Qurtubi elevated the ant to the rank of an examplar for humans to follow.(p196)

**Conquest of Saba'**

Ruins of the Barran Temple at Ma'rib, the former capital of Saba' in what is now Yemen
Another important aspect of Solomon's kingship was the size of his army, which consisted of both men and jinn. Solomon would frequently assess his troops and warriors as well as the jinn and all the animals who worked under him. One day, when inspecting his troops, Solomon found the Hud-hud (ŸáŸèÿØŸíŸáŸèÿØ, Hoopoe) missing from the assembly. Shortly later, however, the Hud-hud arrived to Solomon's court, saying "I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba' with tidings true."The Hud-hud further told Solomon that the people of Sheba worshiped the Sun, and that the woman who ruled the kingdom was highly intelligent and powerful. Solomon, who listened closely, chose to write a letter to the land of Sheba, through which he would try to convince the people of Sheba to cease in worshiping the Sun, and to come to the worship of God. Solomon ordered the Hud-hud to give the letter to the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis), and then to hide and observe her reaction.[9]:‚Ää64‚Ää The Hud-hud accepted Solomon's orders, and flew to give the letter to her. The Queen then called her ministers in the court and announced the letter of Solomon stating to the people of Sheba: "In the name of Allah the Compassionate the Merciful, Be you not exalted against me, but come to me as Muslimƒ´n (ŸÖŸèÿ≥ŸíŸÑŸêŸÖŸêŸäŸíŸÜ)." She asked for suggestions from her minister and administration stating that "O my people, I know that you all are powerful and brave warriors, and no one on the face of the Earth can defeat our army, but still I want your opinion." The people of the court replied: "You have all the power, and whatever order you deliver, you will find us obedient." Eventually, however, the Queen came to Solomon, announcing her submission to God.

**Solomon and the ifrit**

During Bilqis' travel, Solomon asks his servants to deliver her throne to his court. An ifrit offers his service (Q27:38-40), but Solomon declines. Another man is endowed with this task instead, who prays to God for the throne. Afterwards, the prayer is answered and the throne appears thanks to God's power in Solomon's palace. When Bilqis arrives, Solomon asks if she can recognize her throne. She gives him an evasive answer, because she can not grasp the miracle performed here. Since this miracle was done by God (and not by the ifrit), she surrenders to the faith of Solomon. Solomon declined the ifrit's temptatious offer, because he wants to rely on God only and not on the demonic, this leading to his successful conversation of Bilqis.

**Death**

The Quran relates that Solomon died while he was leaning on his staff. Then a creature (an ant or a worm) gnaw at Solomon's staff, until his body collapsed.

	Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the Jinn saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty (of their Task).
	Qur æan, Surah 34 (Saba æ), Ayah 14

As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them.

They realized the truth only when God sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon's staff, until his body collapsed. This verse is understood to teach the audience that jinn do not know the unseen (Al-Ghaib), since if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the service of Solomon.[28]

Ilyas is first mentioned as a prophet in Al-An'am 6:85.[14] He invited his people who lived in Baalbek to monotheism, obeying God and abandoning sins.[15] His main task was to prevent the idol-worshipping.[16] After he faced persistence of his people for many years, cursed them with drought and people were inflicted with starvation.[17] Ilyas' narrative in the Quran and later Muslim tradition resembles closely that in the Hebrew Bible and Muslim literature records Elijah's primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of Ahab and Jezebel as well as Ahaziah.[a] Ilyas' figure has been identified with a number of other prophets and saints, including Idris, which is believed by some scholars to have been another name for Ilyas,[20] and Khidr.[21] Islamic legend later developed the figure of Ilyas, greatly embellishing upon his attributes, and some apocryphal literature gave Ilyas the status of a half-human, half-angel.[22] Ilyas also appears in later works of literature, including the Hamzanama.[23]

#### Ilyas in the Quran
Ilyas is mentioned in the Quran, where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. The Quran narrates that Ilyas told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of Baal, the primary idol of the area. The Quran states:[1]

	"Verily Ilyas was one of the apostles. When he said to his people: "Will you not fear God? "Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old?
	As-Saaffat 123‚Äì126

The Quran makes it clear that the majority of Ilyas' people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. However, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of God among them followed Elijah and believed in and worshiped God. The Quran states, `They denied him (Elijah), and will surely be brought to punishment, Except the sincere and devoted Servants of God (among them). And We left his (memory) for posterity.`

In the Quran, God praises Elijah in two places:

	Peace be upon Elijah! This is how We reward those who do good. He is truly among our believing servants.
	Quran, chapter 37 (As-Saaffat), verse 129‚Äì132[26]
	And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas, they were all from among the righteous
	Quran, chapter 6 (Al-An'am), verse 85[27]

Numerous commentators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, have offered commentary on verse 85 saying that Ilyas, Zakariya, Yahya and Isa were all spiritually connected. Abdullah Yusuf Ali says, "The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: "the Righteous." They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as "Ilyas, which was for to come" (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3)."[28]

Although most Muslim scholars believed that Elijah preached in Israel, some early commentators on the Quran stated that Ilyas was sent to Baalbek, in Lebanon.[29] Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of Baal, which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping. Scholars who reject identification of Elijah's town with Baalbek further argue that the town of Baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of Ilyas in either the Quran or the Hebrew Bible.[30]

#### Death of Ilyas
By the passage of time, drought spread and many died. When they saw themselves inflicted, regretted their past deeds, turned to Elias (a), and accepted his invitation.[31] Then, due to the prayer of Elias (a) a heavy rain came and the land was satiated; however, after a while, people forgot their covenant with God and returned to idol worshipping. When Ilyas saw this, he asked God for his own death; but, God sent him a chariot of fire and he ascended to the skies and chose Alyasa who was his pupil as his vicegerent.[32] Ilyas is rarely associated with Islamic eschatology.[33] However, some Muslims believe that Ilyas is expected to come back along with the mysterious figure Khidr during the end of times.[5]

#### Legacy
Muslim literature and tradition recounts that Ilyas preached to the Kingdom of Israel, ruled over by Ahab and later his son Ahaziah. He is called a "prophet of the desert‚Äîlike Yahya".[34] Ilyas is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of God to Israel after him.[35]

Ilyas has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr. According to a Muslim exegete report, Muhammad met Ilyas in Mecca.[36] In Islamic mysticism, Ilyas is associated closely with the sage Khidr. One hadith reported that Ilyas and Khidr met together every year in Jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca.[37] Ilyas appears also in the Hamzanama numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of Khidr as well as one who drank from the Fountain of Youth.[38] Further, It is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq was reciting the prostration of Ilyas in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars:

"O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?" To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, "Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you".[39]

<summary>Alyasa (Elisha)</summary>
Alyasa (Arabic: ÿßŸÑŸäÿ≥ÿπ, romanized: AlyasƒÅ') is prophet and messenger of God (Allah) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel. In the Quran, Alyasa is mentioned twice as a prophet,[1] and is mentioned both times alongside fellow prophets.[2] He is honored by Muslims as the prophetic successor to Ilyas (Elijah). Islamic sources that identify Elisha with Khidr cite the strong relationship between Khidr and Ilyas in Islamic tradition.[3]

The name of Alyasa is mentioned twice in Al-An'am 6:86 and Sad 38:48. In those verses, without mentioning anything about the personality or prophethood of Alyasa, he is mentioned as "graced" and "among the elect".[4] According to the Quran, Elisha is exalted "above the rest of creation" (Arabic: ŸÅŸéÿ∂ŸéŸëŸÑŸíŸÜŸéÿß ÿπŸéŸÑŸéŸâ Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿπŸéÿßŸÑŸéŸÖŸêŸäŸÜ, romanized: fa·∏ç·∏çalnƒÅ  øala l- øƒÅlamƒ´n(a)[4] and is "among the excellent" (Arabic: ŸÖŸêŸÜŸé Ÿ±ŸÑŸíÿ£ŸéÿÆŸíŸäŸéÿßÿ±, romanized: mina l-akhyƒÅr).[5] Alyasa is mentioned in Al-An'am 6:86 and Sad 38:48, along with Ismail:

	And Ismail and Alyasa and Yunus, and Lut; and each one We graced over the worlds;
	Quran Al-An'am 6:86
	And remember Our servants Ismail, Alyasa, and Dhul-Kifl, each of them truly good.

<summary>Yunus Jonah üê≥ (8-9cen BCE)</summary>
 The companion of the fish üêü.

Yunus ibn Matta (Arabic: ŸäŸèŸàŸÜŸèÿ≥ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ŸÖÿßÿ™ÿß, romanized: Y≈´nus ibn Matta) is a prophet and messenger of God (Allah). Yunus is traditionally viewed as highly important in Islam as a prophet who was faithful to God and delivered His messages. Yunus is the only one of the Bible's Twelve Minor Prophets to be named in the Quran. The tenth chapter of the Quran is named after him.

Yunus is called Dhul-Nun (Arabic: ÿ∞ŸèŸà Ÿ±ŸÑŸÜŸèŸëŸàŸíŸÜ) and by Muslims.[5] He is mentioned four times in the Quran by name.

In Al-Anbiya 21:87 and Al-Qalam 68:48, Yunus is called Dhul-N≈´n (Arabic: ÿ∞ŸèŸà Ÿ±ŸÑŸÜŸèŸëŸàŸíŸÜ, lit.‚Äâ'The One of the Fish').[5] In An-Nisa 4:163 and Al-An'am 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah".[5] Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Yunus:[5]

	So also was Jonah among those sent (by Us).
	When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,
	He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned:
	Then the whale did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.
	Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,
	He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.
	But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,
	And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.
	And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.
	And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.
	Quran, chapter 37 (As-Saaffat), verses 139‚Äì148[8]

The Quran does not mention Yunus' heritage, but Muslim tradition teaches that Yunus was from the tribe of Binyjamin.

#### Hadithic mentions
Yunus is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of Muhammad. In some instances, Yunus' name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical narrations about Muhammad's life, after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of Ta‚Äôif to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than Mecca, but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the Quraysh tribe. They sent their servant, Addas, to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. "The town of Yunus the just, son of Amittai!" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Yunus. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. "We are brothers," Muhammad replied. "Yunus was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.[10]

One of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of Imam Bukhari, says that Muhammad said "One should not say that I am better than Yunus". Ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Yunus not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Day of Resurrection[14] but, because of his prayer, Yunus "stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish".[14]

The ninth-century Persian historian Al-Tabari records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, "none of his bones or members were injured".[14] Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Yunus to see the "wonders of the deep"[15] and that Yunus heard all the fish singing praises to Allah.[15] Kisai Marvazi, a tenth-century poet, records that Yunus' father was seventy years old when Yunus was born[14] and that he died soon afterwards,[14] leaving Yunus' mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a cornucopia.[14]

<summary>Dhu al-Kifl </summary>
(debated, Ezekiel, Budda or other)
Dhu al-Kifl (Arabic: ÿ∞ŸèŸà Ÿ±ŸÑŸíŸÉŸêŸÅŸíŸÑ, ·∏è≈´  æl-kƒ´fl, literally "Possessor of the Kifl‚Äâ"; also spelled Dhu l-Kifl, Dhul-Kifl, Zu al-Kifl, or Zu l-Kifl) is an Islamic prophet. Although his identity is unknown, his identity has been theorised and identified as various Hebrew Bible prophets and other figures, most commonly Ezekiel and Gautama Buddha.[1][2][3][4] Dhu al-Kifl is believed to have been exalted by Allah to a high station in life and is chronicled in the Quran as a man of the "Company of the Good".[5] Although not much is known of Dhu al-Kifl from other historical sources, all the writings from classical commentators, such as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Kathir, speak of Dhu al-Kifl as a prophetic, saintly man who remained faithful in daily prayer and worship.

Dhu al-Kifl has been mentioned twice in the Quran, in the following verses:

And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Dhu al-Kifl, all (men) of constancy and patience.
We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones.

‚Äî‚ÄâQuran, Surah Al-Anbiya (21), Ayahs 85‚Äì86[13]
And commemorate Isma'il, Elisha and Dhu al-Kifl: Each of them was of the Company of the Good.

‚Äî‚ÄâQuran, Surah Sad (38), Ayah 48[14]
In both cases, Dhu al-Kifl is mentioned in the context of a list of Qur'anic prophets, including many others not mentioned in the ayat quoted above.

The Family of Imran) is the third chapter (s≈´rah) of the Quran with two hundred verses (ƒÅyƒÅt).

Imran in Islam is regarded as the father of Mary. This chapter is named after the family of Imran, which includes Imran, Saint Anne (wife of Imran), Mary, and Jesus.

<summary>Maryam (Virgin Mary) is born</summary>

 (Arabic: ŸÖÿ±ŸäŸÖ ÿ®ŸÜÿ™ ÿπŸÖÿ±ÿßŸÜ, Maryam bint Imran) or Maryam, daughter of Imran, mother of Isa (Jesus), holds a singularly exalted place in Islam as the only woman named in the Quran, which refers to her seventy times and explicitly identifies her as the greatest of all women,[1][2][3] stating, with reference to the angelic salutation during the annunciation, "O Mary, God has chosen you, and purified you; He has chosen you above all the women of creation."[4] In the Quran, her story is related in three Meccan chapters (19, 21, 23) and four Medinan surahs (3, 4, 5, 66), and the nineteenth Surah titled Maryam, is named after her. The Quran refers to Mary more often than the Bible.

According to the Quran, divine grace surrounded Mary from birth, and, as a young woman, she received a message from God through the archangel Gabriel that God had chosen her, purified her, and had preferred her above all "the women of the worlds."[7] This event, according to the same narrative, was followed by the annunciation of a child who was to be miraculously conceived by her through the intervention of the divine spirit while she was still virgin, whose name would be Jesus and who would be the "anointed one," the Promised Messiah. As such, orthodox Islamic belief "has upheld the tenet of the virgin birth of Jesus,"[7] and although the classical Islamic thinkers never dwelt on the question of the perpetual virginity of Mary at any great length,[7] it was generally agreed in traditional Islam that Mary remained a virgin throughout her life, with the Quran's mention of Mary's purification ‚Äúfrom the touch of men‚Äù implying perpetual virginity in the minds of many of the most prominent Islamic fathers.

The birth of Mary is narrated in the Quran with references to her father as well as her mother. Mary's father is called Imran. He is the equivalent of Joachim in Christian tradition. Her mother, according to al-Tabari, is called Hannah,[12] which is the same name as in Christian tradition (Saint Anne). Muslim literature narrates that Imran and his wife were old and childless and that, one day, the sight of a bird in a tree feeding her young aroused Anne's desire for a child. She prayed to God to fulfill her desire[17] and vowed, if her prayer was accepted, that her child would be dedicated to the service of God.

According to Iraqi scholar and translator, N.J. Dawood, the Quran confuses Mary mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Moses, by referring to Mary, the mother of Jesus' father as Imran, which is the Arabic version of Amram, who in Exodus 6:20, is shown to be the father of Moses.[18] Dawood, in a note to Quran 19:28, where Mary the Mother of Jesus is referred to as the "Sister of Aaron", and Aaron was the brother of Mary sister of Moses, states: "It Appears that Miriam, Aaron's sister, and Maryam (Mary), mother of Jesus, were according to the Koran, one and the same person."[19] Although Islamic studies of the beginning of the 20th century tended to see this as a mistake in genealogy, in more recent Islamic Studies of the 21st century the general consensus is, according to Angelika Neuwirth, Nicolai Sinai & Michael Marx, that the Quran does not make a genealogical error but instead makes use of Typology.[20] This is, following Wensincks conclusion, supported by the figurative speech of the Quran and the Islamic tradition:
Maryam is called a sister of HƒÅr≈´n and the use of these three names ImrƒÅn, HƒÅr≈´n and Maryam, has led to the supposition that the Kur'ƒÅn does not clearly distinguish between the two Maryams of the Old and the New Testaments. It is not necessary to assume that these kinship links are to be interpreted in modern terms. The words "sister" and "daughter", like their male counterparts, in Arabic usage can indicate extended kinship, descendance or spiritual affinity. Muslim tradition is clear that there are eighteen centuries between the Biblical Amram and the father of Maryam.

Similarly, Stowasser concludes that "to confuse Mary the mother of Jesus with Mary the sister of Moses and Aaron in Torah is completely wrong and in contradiction to the sound Hadith and the Qur'anic text as we have established".

The quranic account of Mary's birth does not affirm an Immaculate Conception for Mary as Islam does not accept the doctrine of original sin, or an inherited fault in humans, as it is found in Christianity. No such doctrine exists in Islam.

A descendant of Caliph Ali, Shia Imam, Ja'far al-Sadiq, describes the birth of Mary in detail. According to one narration, God informs Imran that he will grant him with a boy that will heal the blind and the leper and raise the dead by God's permission. When Imran relays the information to his wife, Hannah, she thought that she would conceive a boy. When she delivered Mary, she said "Oh my Lord! Verily I have delivered a female, and the male is not like the female, for a girl will not be a prophet" to which Allah replies "And God knows better what has been delivered[3:36]". When he granted Jesus to Mary, the promise to Imran was fulfilled.

Early years
The Quran does not, specifically, point to the fact that Mary lived and grew up in a temple as the word mi·∏•'rƒÅb in Quran 3:36 in its literal meaning refers to a private chamber[28][29] or a public/private prayer chamber.[30] The definitive idea of Mary growing up in a temple derived via external literature (i.e. see the narration below by Ja'far al-Sadiq). She was placed under the care of the prophet Zechariah, the husband of Hannah's sister and Mary's maternal uncle and caretaker.[27]:‚Ää16‚Ää As often as Zechariah entered Mary's prayer chamber, he found her provided with food[31] and he would ask her where she received it from, to which she would reply that God provides to whom He wills. Scholars have debated as to whether this refers to miraculous food that Mary received from God or whether it was normal food. Those in favor of the former view state that it had to be miraculous food, as Zechariah being a prophet, would have known that God is the provider of all sustenance and thus would not have questioned Mary, if it was normal food.

Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq narrates that when Maryam was grown, she would go into the mihrab and put on a covering so no one saw her. Zechariah went into the mihrab and found that she had summer fruit in the winter and winter fruit in the summer. He asked "From whence is this?" She said, "It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account"[3:37].[27]:‚Ää16‚Äì17‚Ää

<summary>Virgin Mary gives birth to Jesus</summary>

The virgin birth of Jesus is supremely important in Islam, as one of the most important miracles of God. The first explicit mention of an annunciation foreshadowing the birth of Jesus is in Quran 19:20 where Mary asks Gabriel (Jibril) how she will be able to conceive, when no man has touched her. Gabriel's reply assures Mary that for God all things are easy and that Jesus's virgin birth will be a sign for mankind.[32] The birth is later referred in Quran 66:12,[33] where the Quran states that Mary remained "pure", while God allowed a life to shape itself in Mary's womb. A third mention of the annunciation is in Q3:42‚Äì43, where Mary is also given the glad tidings that she has been chosen above all the women of creation.[34]

Commentators on the Quran remark on the last verse that Mary was as close to a perfect woman as there could be, and she was devoid of almost all failings.[35] Although Islam honors numerous women, including Zipporah, Hagar, Sarah, Asiya, Khadijah, Fatimah, Ayesha, Hafsa many commentators[36] followed this verse in the absolute sense, and agreed that Mary was the greatest woman of all time.[35] Other commentators, however, while maintaining that Mary was the "queen of the saints", interpreted this verse to mean that Mary was the greatest woman of that time and that Fatimah, Khadijah and Asiya were equally great.[35][37] According to exegesis and literature, Gabriel appeared to Mary, who was still young in age, in the form of a well-made man with a "shining face" and announced to her the birth of Jesus. After her immediate astonishment, she was reassured by the angel's answer that God has the power to do anything.[35] The details of the conception are not discussed during these angelic visits, but elsewhere the Quran states (Quran 21:91)[38] and 66:12[33]) that God breathed "His Spirit" into Mary while she was chaste.
Mary shaking the palm tree for dates, a legend derived from the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew.[41]
According to the Quran, Mary was chosen twice by the Lord: "O Mary! Verily Allah has chosen you and puriÔ¨Åed you and chosen you above the women of the worlds" (Quran 3:42); and the first choosing was her selection with glad tidings given to Imran. The second was that she became pregnant without a man, so in this regard, she was chosen over all other women in the world.[27]:‚Ää16‚Ää

The Quran narrates the virgin birth of Jesus numerous times. In chapter 19 (Maryam), verses (ayat) 17‚Äì21,[42] the annunciation is given, followed by the virgin birth in due course. In Islam, Jesus is called the "spirit of God" because he was through the action of the spirit, but that belief does not include the doctrine of his pre-existence, as it does in Christianity.[43] Quran 3:47 also supports the virginity of Mary, revealing that "no man has touched [her]".[44] Quran 66:12[33] states that Jesus was born when the spirit of God breathed upon Mary, whose body was chaste.[45]

According to the Quran, the following conversation transpired between the angel Gabriel and Mary when he appeared to her in the form of a man:

And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our spirit, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man. She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah." He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you a pure boy." She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?" He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.'[19:16-21]

The Quran's narrative of the virgin birth is somewhat different from that in the New Testament. The Quran states that when the pains of childbirth came upon Mary, she held onto a nearby palm tree, at which point a voice came from "beneath the (palm-tree)" or "beneath her", which said " "Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; "And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee."[46] The Quran goes on to describe that Mary vowed not to speak to any man on that day,[47] as God was to make Jesus, who Muslims believe spoke in the cradle, perform his first miracle. The Quran goes on to narrate that Mary then brought Jesus to the temple, where immediately she began to be taunted by all the men, excluding Zechariah, who believed in the virgin birth. The Israelites questioned Mary how she came to be with child whilst unmarried, to which Mary pointed to the baby Jesus. It was then that, according to the Quran, the infant Jesus began to speak in the cradle, and spoke of his prophecy for the first time.[48]

According to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, Jesus the son of Mary used to cry intensely as a child, so that Mary was at wits end regarding his profuse crying. He said to her, "Get some of the bark of that tree, make a tonic from it and feed me with it." When he drank it, he cried intensely. Mary said, "What sort of prescription did you give me?" He said, "Oh my mother! Knowledge of prophet-hood and weakness of childhood."[27]:‚Ää23‚Ää

The Fatimid Ismaili jurist Qadi al-Nu‚Äôman holds that the virgin birth of Jesus is meant to be interpreted symbolically. In his interpretation, Mary was the follower (lƒÅ·∏•iq), of the Imam Joachim (‚ÄòImran). However, when Joachim realized that she was not suited for the Imamah, he passed it to Zechariah, who then passed it to John the Baptist. Meanwhile, Mary received spiritual inspiration (mƒÅdda) from God, revealing that he would invite a man [to the faith] who would become an exalted Speaker (nƒÅ·π≠iq) of a revealed religion (sharƒ´ øa). According to al-Nu‚Äôman, the verses ‚ÄúShe said: Lord! How can I have a child when no man has touched me?‚Äù (Quran 3:47) and ‚Äúneither have I been unchaste‚Äù (Quran 19:20) are symbolic of Mary's saying, ‚ÄúHow can I conduct the invitation (da øwa) when the Imam of the Time has not given me permission to do so?‚Äù and ‚ÄúNor shall I be unfaithful by acting against his command‚Äù, respectively. To this, a celestial hierarch replies ‚ÄúSuch is God. He creates [i.e., causes to pass] what he wills‚Äù (Quran 3:47).

<summary>Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn Zakarƒ´yƒÅ** (John the Baptist)</summary>
1 century BC

Ya·∏•yƒÅ ibn Zakarƒ´yƒÅ (Arabic: Ÿäÿ≠ŸäŸâ ÿßÿ®ŸÜ ÿ≤ŸÉÿ±Ÿäÿß, literally Yahya/John, son of Zechariah), identified in English as John the Baptist, is considered in Islam a prophet and messenger of God (Allah) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel. He is believed by Muslims to have been a witness to the word of God who would herald the coming of Isa Masih (Jesus).

Yahya is mentioned five times in the Quran.

Yahya is also honored highly in Sufism as well as Islamic mysticism, primarily because of the Quran's description of John's chastity and kindness.[4] Sufis have frequently applied commentaries on the passages on John in the Quran, primarily concerning the God-given gift of wisdom which he acquired in youth as well as his parallels with Jesus. Although several phrases used to describe John and Jesus are virtually identical in the Quran, the manner in which they are expressed is different.

In the Quran, God frequently mentions Zakariya's continuous praying for the birth of a son. Zakariya's wife, was barren and therefore the birth of a child seemed impossible.[6] As a gift from God, Zechariah was given a son by the name of Ya·∏•ya, a name specially chosen for this child alone. In accordance with Zakariya's prayer, God made Yahya and Isa, who according to exegesis was born six months later,[7] renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and distorted by the Israelites.

The Quran claims that John the Baptist was the first to receive this name (Quran 19:7‚Äì10) but since the name Yo·∏•anan occurs many times before John the Baptist,[8] this verse is referring either to Islamic scholar consensus that "Ya·∏•yƒÅ" is not the same name as "Yo·∏•anan"[9] or to the Biblical account of the miraculous naming of John, which accounted that he was almost named "Zacharias" (Greek: ŒñŒ±œáŒ±œÅŒØŒ±œÇ)[10] after his father's name, as no one in the lineage of his father Zacharias (also known as Zechariah) had been named "John" ("Yohanan"/"Yoannes") before him.[11] As the Quran says:[12]
"O Zakaryya, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be Yahya, and whose we never before have created sameness for.

He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?"

He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'"

(Zakarya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights."

‚Äî‚ÄâMaryam 19: 7‚Äì10
Prophethood

The Jordan River, where Yahya baptized Isa.[13]
Yahya was exhorted to hold fast to the scripture and was given wisdom by God while still a child.[14] He was pure and devout, and walked well in the presence of God. He was dutiful towards his parents and he was not arrogant or rebellious. John's reading and understanding of the scriptures, when only a child, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time.[6] Muslim exegesis narrates that Isa sent Yahya out with twelve disciples,[15] who preached the message before Jesus called his own disciples.[7] The Quran says:[16]
"O Ya·∏•ya! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,

‚Äî‚ÄâMaryam, 19:12
John was a classical prophet,[17] who was exalted high by God for his bold denouncing of all things sinful. Furthermore, the Quran speaks of John's gentle piety and love and his humble attitude towards life, for which he was granted the purity of Life.

According to Islamic tradition, Yahya used to go to the Haram esh-Sharif (Temple Mount) to deliver his sermons.[3]

During the prophethood of Yahya, a conflict occurred between him and Herod Antipas, who wanted to divorce his first wife and take as wife his former sister-in-law.[3] Yahya informed that the marriage might be incestuous, and did not approve of the marriage. After this, Herod Antipas had Yahya imprisoned.[3] Yahya was then decapitated.[18][3] Yahya's head is believed to be inside the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus.

<summary>Isa (Jesus of Nazareth)</summary>
Isa ibn Maryam (Arabic: ÿπŸêŸäÿ≥ŸéŸâ Ÿ±ÿ®ŸíŸÜŸè ŸÖŸéÿ±ŸíŸäŸéŸÖŸé, lit.‚Äâ'Jesus, son of Mary'), is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah, who was sent to guide the Children of Israel with a revelation: Injƒ´l (Arabic for "gospel").

As in the Christian New Testament, the Quran (the central religious text of Islam) describes Jesus as al-Masƒ´·∏• (Arabic for messiah), born of a virgin, performing miracles, accompanied by disciples, rejected by the Jewish establishment, and being raised to heaven. The Quran firmly states that Jesus is not divine and he is not the Son of God. Also, the Quran differs from the New Testament in proclaiming that Jesus was neither crucified nor died on the cross.

The significance of Jesus in Islam is reflected in his being mentioned in the Quran in 93 verses with various titles attached such as "Son of Mary", "Spirit of God", and the "Word of God", and other relational titles, mentioned directly and indirectly, over 187 times. Jesus is more briefly described in Surah Maryam, Chapter 19 of Quran. Thus, he is one of the most mentioned people in the Quran by reference; 25 times by the name Isa,[note 1] third-person 48 times,[note 2] first-person 35 times and the rest as titles.

The Quran and ahadith (testimonial reports) mention Jesus to have been born a "pure boy" (without sin) to Maryam (Mary) as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity. The Quran denies Jesus as a deity in several verses, including one that mentions that Jesus did not claim to be divine (Q5:116). According to the Quran, he was not crucified,[16] but was rather saved by God. (Although the earliest Islamic traditions and exegesis quote somewhat conflicting reports regarding a death and its length, Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the cross, but still believe that he was raised alive to heaven). Over the centuries, Muslim writers have referenced other miracles like casting out demons, having borrowed from some heretical pre-Islamic sources, and from canonical sources as legends about Jesus were expanded.

In Islam, Jesus is believed to have been the precursor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. According to the Quran, the coming of Muhammad was predicted by Jesus in As-Saff 61:6. Through this verse, early Arab Muslims claimed legitimacy for their new faith in the existing religious traditions and the alleged predictions of Jesus. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is also called a Muslim, as he preached that his followers should adopt the "straight path". In Islamic eschatology, Jesus will return in a Second Coming to fight Al-Masih ad-Dajjal or the "False Messiah" as well as Gog and Magog and establish peace and justice on earth.

Birth narratives

According to the Quran, the pains of labor took Mary to the trunk of a palm tree.
The Islamic faith echoed some strands within the Christian tradition that Mary (or Maryam) was a literal virgin when Jesus was conceived. The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in Surah 3 (Al Imran) and 19 (Maryam) of the Quran where the story is narrated that God (Allah) sent an angel to announce that Maryam could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.[36]

Some academics have noted that the account in Surah 19[37] is particularly close to that in the Christian Gospel of Luke.[38] The Annunciation to Mary is mentioned twice in the Quran and in both instances Mary/ Maryam is told that she was chosen by God to deliver a son. In the first instance, the bearer of the news (who is believed by most Muslims to be the archangel Gabriel), delivered the news in (Q3:42-47) as he takes the form of a man (Q19:16-22). The details of the conception are not discussed but when Mary asks how she can bear a son in view of her chastity she is told that God creates what he wills and that these things are easy for God. The Quran (Q21:91 and Q66:12) says that God blew through his angel into Mary and she, although being chaste, bore Jesus without any father.

The account of the birth of Jesus follows the Quran's narrative, adding that the birth occurred in Bethlehem beside a palm tree with a manger.

Childhood
Main article: Finding in the Temple
See also: Flight into Egypt and Infancy Gospel of Thomas
The Quran does not include the tradition of the Flight into Egypt, though s≈´ra XXIII, 50 could conceivably allude to it: "And we made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs."[48] However, narratives similar to the narrative found in the Gospels and non-canonical sources circulated in later Islamic tradition, with some details and elaborations being added over the centuries by Islamic writers and historians. Some narratives have Jesus and family staying in Egypt up to 12 years.[20] Many moral stories and miraculous events of Jesus' youth are mentioned in Qisas al-anbiya (Stories of the Prophets), books composed over the centuries about pre-Islamic prophets and heroes.

Adulthood

Mission

It is generally agreed that Jesus spoke Aramaic, the common language of Judea in the first century A.D. and the region at-large.[52]

The first and earliest view of Jesus formulated in Islamic thought is that of a prophet ‚Äì a human being chosen by God to present both a judgment upon humanity for worshipping idols and a challenge to turn to the one true God. From this basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Jesus is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. The miracles of Jesus and the quranic titles attributed to Jesus demonstrate the power of God rather than the divinity of Jesus ‚Äì the same power behind the message of all prophets. Some Islamic traditions believe Jesus' mission was only to the people of Israel and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.

A second early high image of Jesus is an end-time figure. This concept arises mostly from the Hadith. Muslim tradition constructs a narrative similarly found in Christian theology, seeing Jesus arriving at the end of time and descending upon earth to fight the Antichrist. This narrative is understood to champion the cause of Islam, with some traditions narrating Jesus pointing to the primacy of Muhammad. Most traditions state Jesus will then die a natural death.

A third and distinctive image is of Jesus representing an ascetic figure ‚Äì a prophet of the heart. Although the Quran refers to the 'gospel' of Jesus, those specific teachings of his are not mentioned in the Quran or later religious texts. They are largely absent. The Sufi tradition is where Jesus became revered, acknowledged as a spiritual teacher with a distinctive voice from other prophets, including Muhammad. Sufism tends to explore the dimensions of union with God through many approaches, including asceticism, poetry, philosophy, speculative suggestion, and mystical methods. Although Sufism to the Western mind may seem to share similar origins or elements of Neoplatonism, Gnosticism, and Buddhism, the ideology is distinctly Islamic since they adhere to the words of the Quran and pursue imitation of Muhammad as the perfect man.

Miracles
Main article: Miracles of Jesus
See also: Infancy Gospel of Thomas
The Quran attributes at least six miracles to Jesus, with many more being added over the centuries by writers and historians. Miracles were attributed to Jesus as signs of his prophethood and his authority, according to educator and professor Ishaq Musa Al-Husayni (d. 1990), an author most known for Mudhakkirat Dajaja (Memoirs of a Hen) (Cairo: Dar al-Maarif, 1943; 2nd ed. 1967). In Christ in the Quran and Modern Arabic Literature (1960), Al-Husayni said it is noteworthy Muhammad attributes no miracles to himself.[59]

These six miracles in the Quran are without detail unlike the Gospel and their non-canonical Gnostic sources, which include details and mention other attributed miracles.[59] Over the centuries, these six miracle narratives have been elaborated through Hadith and poetry, with religious writings including some of the other miracles mentioned in the Gospel, non-canonical sources, and from lore.[20][50]

Speaking from the cradle
Speaking from the cradle is mentioned in three places in the Quran: al-Imran (3) 41, 46, al-Maida (5) 109‚Äì110 and Maryam (19) 29‚Äì30. Part of the narrative has the infant Jesus defending his mother Mary from the accusation of having given birth without a known husband.[60] Early Islam was unclear about Joseph and his role.Thus these Gnostic gospel influence is claimed as to say Quran may not be divine by opponents. Jesus speaks as the angel Gabriel had mentioned at the annunciation: Jesus proclaims he is a servant of God, has been given a book, is a prophet, is blessed wherever he will go, blesses the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he is raised alive.[61]

Although this particular narrative is not found in the Bible, the theme of speaking from the cradle is found in the non-canonical pre-Islamic Syriac Infancy Gospel. That source has Jesus declaring himself the Son of God, the Word, and affirming what the angel Gabriel had previously announced to Mary as detailed in the Gospel.[60]

Creating birds from clay
The miracle story of creating birds from clay and breathing life into them when a child is mentioned in al-Imran (3) 43, 49 and al-Maida (5) 109‚Äì110. Although this miracle is also not mentioned the canonical Gospel, the same narrative is found in at least two pre-Islamic sources: the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the Jewish Toledot Yeshu, with few variant details between the Quran and these two sources.[62][63]

Healing the blind and the lepers
See also: Healing the two blind men in Galilee and Cleansing ten lepers
Similar to the New Testament, the Quran mentions Jesus healing the blind and the lepers in al-Imran (3) 49. Muslim scholar and judge al-Baydawi (d. 1286) wrote how it was recorded that many thousands of people came to Jesus to be healed and that Jesus healed these diseases through prayer only.[64] Medieval scholar al-Tha'labi wrote about how these two particular diseases were beyond medical help, and Jesus' miracles were meant to be witnessed by others as clear signs of his message.[62]

Raising the dead
Jesus is believed to have raised people from the dead, as mentioned in al-Imran (3) 49. Although no detail is given as to who was raised or the circumstance, at least three people are mentioned in detail in the Gospel (a daughter of Jairus, a widow's son at Nain, and Lazarus).[65]

Prescience
Jesus was able to predict, or had foreknowledge,[66] of what was hidden or unknown to others. One example is Jesus would answer correctly any and every question anyone asked him. Another example is Jesus knew what people had just eaten, as well as what they had stored in their homes.[20]

Table of food from heaven
Main article: Feeding the multitude
See also: Last Supper
In the fifth chapter of the Quran, al-Ma'ida (5) 112‚Äì115, a narration mentions the disciples of Jesus requesting a table laden with food, and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future. This may be a possible reference to the Eucharist according to professor of Islamic and Arabic studies W. Montgomery Watt (d. 2006).[67] According to professor of comparative religions Geoffrey Parrinder (d. 2005), it is unclear if this story parallels the Gospel's Last Supper or the feeding the multitude, but may be tied to the Arabic word  øƒ´d (Muslim festival):[68]

One time the disciples said, O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down for us a table from heaven? He said, Fear God if you are believers. They said We want to eat of it, and that our hearts may be at peace, and we may know you have spoken truthfully and be among the witnesses to it. Jesus, son of Mary, said, O God our Lord send down upon us a table from heaven, to be for us a festival, for the first of us and the last of us, and a sign from you: and give provision (of food) to us, for you are the best of providers. God said I am sending it down for you.[67]

In a record by the Sunni exegete Tabari, before the last supper, the threat of death made him anxious. Therefore, Jesus invited his disciples for the last supper. After the meal, he washed their hands and performed their ablutions to wipe their hands on his clothing. Afterwards Jesus replied to them: "As for that I have done to you tonight, in that I served you the meal and washed your hands in person, let it be an example for you. Since you indeed consider me to be better than you, do not be haughty in relation to each other but rather expand yourselves for each other as I have expanded myself for you." After instructing the disciples in his teachings, Jesus foretells that one of them would deny him and another betray him. However, in accordance with Islamic views on Jesus' death, just a corpse in semblance of Jesus was crucified and Jesus himself was raised to God.[69]

Other miracles
Many stories and narratives have been developed over the years about Jesus, containing certain inherent lessons or providing meaning due to the lack of detail in the Quran regarding Jesus. Some of these narratives are similar in nature to the New Testament, while some portray Jesus in a very human manner.

Besides some detailed summaries of miracles of Jesus mentioned by Muslim writers over the centuries, from adulthood (like walking on water ‚Äì also found in the Gospel ‚Äì and causing loaves of bread to come from the ground), some other miracles from childhood include: explaining the Muslim creed fundamentals to a schoolmaster, revealing who the thieves were to a wealthy chief, filling empty jars of something to drink, providing food and wine for a tyrannical king while also proving to this king his power in raising a dead man from the dead, raising a child accidentally killed, and causing the garments from a single-colored vat to come out with various colors.

Healing a royal official's son
Main article: Healing the royal official's son
Al-Tabari (d. 923) reports a story of an adult Jesus' encounter with a certain king in the region and the healing of his son. The identity of the king is not mentioned while legend suggests Philip the Tetrarch. The corresponding Bible reference is "the royal official's son".

Greed and truth-telling
A legendary story of a miracle by a young Jesus, used as a hard-learned lesson popularly found in Middle Eastern lore according to professor Ayoub, has to do with a Jewish man and loaves of bread. Although carrying a polemic tone, the lesson centers on greed with truth-telling woven into the narration. It is a story found often in children's books.[71]

Inherent wisdom
See also: Logos (Islam) and Logos (Christianity)
Another legendary miracle story is one regarding Jesus' childhood wisdom. This legend, reported through al-Tabari from ibn Ishaq, talks about Mary sending Jesus to a religious school and the teacher being astonished to find Jesus already knowing the information being taught / discussed.

Food in children's homes
Another story from al-Tabari tells of a young Jesus playing with the youths of his village and telling them what food their parents were preparing for them at home.

According to the details of the narrative, some parents became annoyed and forbade their children to play with Jesus, suspecting he was a magician. As a result, the parents kept their children away from Jesus and gathered their children into a single house. One day, feeling lonely, Jesus went out looking for his friends, and coming upon this house he asked the parents where their children were. The parents lied, responding that the children were not there. After Jesus asks who, then, is in the house, the parents call Jesus a pig. Jesus then says "Let there be swine in this house", turning all the children into swine.[50]

Revelation
Main article: Gospel in Islam
See also: Ministry of Jesus
Muslims believe that God revealed to Jesus a new scripture, al-Injƒ´l (the Gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: al-Tawrat (the Torah) and al-Zabur (the Psalms). The Quran speaks favorably of al-Injƒ´l, which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety. Traditional Islamic exegesis claiming the biblical message to have been distorted or corrupted (tahrif), is termed ta'yin al-mubham ("resolution of ambiguity").[72] This polemic effort has its origins in the medieval period with Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad's writings.[73]

Regarding the Law of Moses, the Quran indicates that Jesus never abolished Jewish laws but rather confirmed them, while making partial abrogations only.[74]

Islam rejects Paul's theology of justification before God by faith alone as held by some Protestants or faith through grace as held by Catholics, Orthodox and most mainline Protestants. Jesus' legal perspective did not involve a New Covenant concerning works,[citation needed] but to simply modify those existing laws.[citation needed] Shabir Ally considers this understanding to corroborate with the canonical gospels that include Matthew 5:17.

Disciples
In the Qur'an
The following is a list of all the Qur'anic references to the disciples of Jesus:

But when Jesus felt [persistence in] disbelief from them, he said, "Who are my supporters for [the cause of] Allah?" The disciples said, "We are supporters for Allah. We have believed in Allah and testify that we are Muslims [submitting to Him]. (52) Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed and have followed the messenger [i.e., Jesus], so register us among the witnesses [to truth]."(53)

‚Äî‚ÄâQur'an 3:52-53[1]
And [remember] when I inspired to the disciples, "Believe in Me and in My messenger [i.e., Jesus]." They said, "We have believed, so bear witness that indeed we are Muslims [in submission to Allah]."(111) [And remember] when the disciples said, "O Jesus, Son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven?" [Jesus] said, "Fear Allah, if you should be believers."(112) They said, "We wish to eat from it and let our hearts be reassured and know that you have been truthful to us and be among its witnesses."(113) Said Jesus, the son of Mary, "O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table [spread with food] from the heaven to be for us a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, and You are the best of providers."(114) Allah said, "Indeed, I will send it down to you, but whoever disbelieves afterwards from among you - then indeed will I punish him with a punishment by which I have not punished anyone among the worlds."(115)

‚Äî‚ÄâQuran 5:111-115[4]
O you who have believed, be supporters of Allah, as when Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, "Who are my supporters for Allah?" The disciples said, "We are supporters of Allah." And a faction of the Children of Israel believed and a faction disbelieved. So We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they became dominant. (14)

‚Äî‚ÄâQuran 61:14[5]
In Hadith
The following are Hadith (narrations originating from the words of Muhammad), collected by Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj Nishapuri, which indirectly emphasize Islamic beliefs concerning the disciples of Jesus:[6]

It is narrated on the authority 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud that the Messenger of God observed: Never a Prophet had been sent before me by God towards his nation who had not among his people (his) disciples and companions who followed his ways and obeyed his command. Then there came after them their successors who said whatever they did not practise, and practised whatever they were not commanded to do. He who strove against them with his hand was a believer: he who strove against them with his tongue was a believer, and he who strove against them with his heart was a believer and beyond that there is no faith even to the extent of a mustard seed. Abu Rafi' said: I narrated this hadith to 'Abdullah b. 'Umar; he contradicted me. There happened to come 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud who stayed at Qanat, and 'Abdullah b 'Umar wanted me to accompany him for visiting him (as 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud was ailing), so I went along with him and as we sat (before him) I asked Ibn Mas'ud about this hadith. He narrated it in the same way as I narrated it to Ibn 'Umar. The same hadith has been transmitted by another chain of narrators on the authority of 'Abdullah b. Mas'ud who observed: Never was there one among the prophets who had had not disciples who followed his direction and followed his ways. The remaining part of the hadith is like that as narrated by Salih but the arrival of Ibn Mas'ud and the meeting of Ibn 'Umar with him is not mentioned.

‚Äî‚ÄâSahih Muslim[7]
Death
Main article: Islamic view of Jesus' death
The primary quranic verse dealing with the event of the crucifixion is Surah 4 Verse 157:

That they said (in boast), "We killed the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, the Messenger of The God'; but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts, with no (certain) knowledge, but only conjecture to follow, for of a surety they killed him not.

Most Islamic traditions categorically deny that Jesus physically died on the cross or otherwise. Most traditions instead teach substitution, or the idea that another person was crucified in Jesus' place. However, some modern Muslim scholars believe that Jesus did indeed die, and references to his survival are symbolic, not literal. This disagreement on the nature of Jesus' death is found within the Islamic canon itself, with the earliest Hadith quoting the companions of Muhammad saying that Jesus had died. Meanwhile, the majority of subsequent Hadith and Tafsir argue in favor of the opposite.

Substitution
It is unclear exactly where the substitutionist interpretation originated, but some scholars consider the theory originating among certain Gnostic groups of the second century.[35] Leirvik finds the Quran and Hadith to have been clearly influenced by the non-canonical ('heretical') Christianity that prevailed in the Arab peninsula and further in Abyssinia.[78]

Muslim commentators have been unable to convincingly disprove the crucifixion. Rather, the problem has been compounded by adding the conclusion of their substitutionist theories. The problem has been one of understanding.

If the substitutionist interpretation (Christ replaced on the cross) is taken as a valid reading of the Qur'anic text, the question arises of whether this idea is represented in Christian sources. According to Irenaeus' Adversus Haereses, the Egyptian Gnostic Christian Basilides (2nd century) held the view that Christ (the divine nous, intelligence) was not crucified, but was replaced by Simon of Cyrene. However, both Clement of Alexandria and Hippolytus denied that Basilides held this view. But the substitutionist idea in general form is quite clearly expressed in the Gnostic Nag Hammadi documents Apocalypse of Peter and The Second Treatise of the Great Seth.

While most Western scholars, Jews, and Christians believe Jesus died, orthodox Muslim theology teaches he ascended to Heaven without being put on the cross and God transformed another person, Simon of Cyrene, to appear exactly like Jesus who was crucified instead of Jesus (cf. Irenaeus' description of the heresy of Basilides, Book I, ch. XXIV, 4.).[83]

Some disagreement and discord can be seen beginning with Ibn Ishaq's (d. 761) report of a brief accounting of events leading up to the crucifixion, firstly stating that Jesus was replaced by someone named Sergius, while secondly reporting an account of Jesus' tomb being located at Medina and thirdly citing the places in the Quran (3:55; 4:158) that God took Jesus up to himself.

Michael Cook notes that denial that Jesus died follows the Christian heresy of Docetism, who were "disturbed by that God should have died", but that this concern conflicts with another Islamic doctrine, that Jesus was a man, not God.[84] Quranic commentators seem to have concluded the denial of the crucifixion of Jesus by following material interpreted in Tafsir that relied upon extra-biblical Judeo-Christian sources, with the earliest textual evidence having originated from a non-Muslim source; a misreading of the Christian writings of John of Damascus regarding the literal understandings of Docetism (exegetical doctrine describing spiritual and physical realities of Jesus as understood by men in logical terms) as opposed to their figurative explanations. John of Damascus highlighted the Quran's assertion that the Jews did not crucify Jesus being very different from saying that Jesus was not crucified, explaining that it is the varied Quranic exegetes in Tafsir, and not the Quran itself, that denies the crucifixion, further stating that the message in the 4:157 verse simply affirms the historicity of the event.

Second coming
See also: Second Coming ¬ß Islam, Islamic eschatology, and Hadith of Jesus praying behind Mahdi
According to Islamic tradition which describes this graphically, Jesus' descent will be in the midst of wars fought by the Mahdi (lit. "the rightly guided one"), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against al-Masih ad-Dajjal (the Antichrist "false messiah") and his followers. Jesus will descend at the point of a white minaret, east of Damascus (believed to be the Minaret of Isa in the Umayyad Mosque), dressed in yellow robes‚Äîhis head anointed. He will say prayer behind al-Mahdi then join him in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist, and then everyone who is one of the People of the Book (ahl al-kitƒÅb, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.

Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 43: Kitab-ul-Ilm (Book of Knowledge), H√¢dith Number 656:
Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the swine, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts)."

<summary> Christianity before Nicean Creed</summary>

There was a time when Christianity was very close to Islam.

Constantine the founder of Constantinople (a.k.a. Istanbul). Constantine was the first emperor to stop the persecution of Christians and to legalize Christianity. and he accepted Christianity. So, the Roman Empire became Christian.

Constantine the Great or Constantine I initiated the First Council of Nicea.

Arius who believed that Jesus aws created by God and there are not equal in status was exiled after https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea during emperor of Rome Constantine 1.
The Arisian version of Christianity was very close to Islam. 
Peter the Venerable said that Muhammad saw was the successor to Arius.

Nicaea was all about Arius and Constantine wanted to establish peace among his own ruling lands.
There was no Trinity before the Nicaea Creed.
and the first person who expounded this doctrine was Paul.

Jesus attemded Jewish temples and he just logically couldn't claim that he is God. The disciples also attended Jewish temples and worshipped God alone. 
Jesus came to revive the religion of Moses, not to build new churches and invent a new religion.

Contradictions in the Bible. Also it is important to take into account that the Bible cannot be fully called the Word of God because it was translated from it's original language and corrupted by writers of multiple epochs.

Jesus was Jewish and he was circumsized. He used to

When Khuzagha attacked Jurhum, Jurhum hid the Zamzam before they leave.

At that time, Khuzagha was controlling Mecca. he married chieftan's daughter and after the chieftan died, people wanted Qusayy to take over so he united Quraish tribes and fought against sons of Khuzagha chieftan and reclaimed the control over Mecca for the Quraish.

They were receiving taxes, feeding the pilgrims and living in tents. Qusayy told them to build houses. His hidden qualities enabled him to establish his superiority over the Makkans and especially the tribe of Quraysh. Within a short time he acquired the high governmental offices in Makkah and also became the custodian of the keys of the Ka'bah and the undisputed ruler of that city.

Many remarkable events are associated with his name. One of these was that he encouraged the people to construct a house with the name of 'Darun Nadwah' adjacent to the Ka'bah and thus founded a Council Hall for the Arabs so that their dignitaries and chiefs might sit together in this public centre and solve their problems. He died in the 5th A.D. and left behind two sons named Abdud Dar and Abd Manaf.

#### Hashim

Abd Manaf's son.
his name is Amr. Hashim was the father of Abdul Muttalib. He established caravans to Yemen and Syria. married an influential Yathrib woman from Khazraj. He fell ill and died in Gaza. (Surah Quraish mentions these caravans.)
the silk road was going through Basra. So Hashim hooked to the Silk Road and connected Yemen and Basra. and in the middle was Mecca. and Mecca had people who would come to Hajj, so there was the market.

and it was a safe route because of Mecca was a holy sight.
One of Hashim's wives was from Yathrib.

Mutallib want to claim the Zamzam prestige on his family so he prays that if Allaha gives him 10 sons to protect him, he will sacrifice one of them for Allah. The tribes decide to go to the fortuneteller to decide the destiny of Zamzam but they get lost and without food they decide that everyone should dig their own graves. so while they dig Muttalib again finds water. So tribes decide that this is the sign and claim that Zamzam is his.

>This happened in the year the prophet Muhammad (sww) was born and hence this even it was called The Year of the Elephant.
>
>The prophet Muhammad (sww) has received a surah about this event, **surah Al-Fil**.


The War of Elephants took place eight years before the death of Abd Al Muttalib. By then, he was the patriarch of the tribe.

The Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abraha al-Ashram, envied the reverence in which the Ka'bah was held by the Arabs. Being a staunch Christian, he built a big cathedral in Sanaa (the capital of Yemen) and ordered the Arabs to go there for pilgrimage instead. The order was ignored. Not only that; someone entered the cathedral and made it unclean. The wrath of Abraha knew no bounds. In his fury, he decided to avenge it by demolishing and desecrating the Ka'bah itself. He advanced with a large army towards Mecca.
 
There were many elephants in his army; he himself rode a huge elephant. It was an animal which the Arabs had not seen before, thus the year came to be known as 'Amul-Fil (the year of the elephant), and it started an era for reckoning the years in Arabia. This remained in use until the days of 'Umar ibn al ¬≠Khattab when, on the advice of Hazrat 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, he replaced it with the era of Hijra.
 
When news of the advance of Abraha's army came, the Arabian tribes of Quraish, Kinanah, Khuza'ah and Hudhayl joined together to defend the Ka'bah. Abraha sent a small contingent towards Mecca to capture the camels and young people. The contingent captured many animals, including two hundred of 'Abdul-Muttalib's.
 
Meanwhile, a man from the tribe of Himyar was sent by Abraha to Quraish to advise them that Abraha had not come to fight them: his only aim was to demolish the Ka'bah. But if the Quraish resisted, they would be crushed. Then followed a frightening description of his huge army, which, admittedly, was much larger and better equipped than all the tribes put together.
 
'Abdul-Muttalib replied to this ultimatum in these words: "By Allah, we do not want to fight him. So far as this House (the Ka'bah) is concerned, it is the House of Allah; if Allah wants to save His House, He will save it, and if He leaves it unprotected, no one can save it."
 
Then 'Abdul-Muttalib, with 'Amr ibn Lu'aba and some other prominent leaders, went to see Abraha. Abraha was informed before hand of the prestige and position of 'Abdul-Muttalib. Also the personality of 'Abdul-Muttalib was very impressive and awe¬≠inspiring. When he entered Abraha's tent, the latter rose from his throne, warmly welcomed him, and seated him beside him on the carpet. During the conversation, 'Abdul-Muttalib requested him to release his camels. Abraha was astonished. He said: "When my eyes fell upon you, I was so impressed by you that had you requested me to withdraw my army and go back to Yemen, I would have granted that request. But now, I have no respect for you. Why? Here I have come to demolish the House which is the religious center of yours and of your forefathers and the foundation of your prestige and respect in Arabia, and you say nothing to save it; instead, you ask me to return your few camels back to you?!"
 
'Abdul-Muttalib said: "I am the owner of the camels, (therefore, I tried to save them), and this House has its own Owner Who will surely protect it." Abraha was stunned by this reply. He ordered the camels to be released, and the deputation of Quraish returned.
 
On the second day, Abraha issued orders to his army to enter Mecca. 'Abdul-Muttalib told the Meccans to leave the city and to seek refuge in the surrounding hills. But he, together with some leading members of Quraish, remained within the precincts of the Ka'bah. Abraha sent someone to warn them to vacate the building. When the messenger came, he asked the people who their leader was. All fingers pointed towards 'Abdul-Muttalib. He was again invited to go to Abraha where he had a talk with him. When he came out, he was heard saying: "The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House."
 
'Abdul-Muttalib then took hold of the door of the Ka'bah and, crying to Allah, prayed in the following words (of poetry):
 
(O Allah! Surely a man defends his own home, therefore, Thou shouldst protect Thy Own House. Their cross and their wrath can never overcome Thy wrath. O Allah, help Thy Own people against the fellows of the cross and its worshippers).
 
Then he, too, went to the summit of the hill, Abu Qubays. Abraha advanced with his army. Seeing the walls of the Ka'bah, he ordered its demolition. No sooner had the army reached near the Ka'bah than an army of Allah appeared from the western side. A dark cloud of small birds (known in Arabic as Ababil) overshadowed the entire army of Abraha. Each bird had three pebbles: two in its claws and one in its beak. A rain of the pebbles poured down from the birds, and in a few minutes, the whole army was destroyed. Abraha himself was seriously wounded; he fled towards Yemen but died on the way.
 
It is to this important event that Allah refers in Chapter 105:
 
	"Have you not considered, [O Muhammad], how your Lord dealt with the companions of the Elephant? Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray? And He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up."
	Quran, 105 Surah Al-Fil
 
Some historians have tried to minimize the impact of the Divine intervention by suggesting that the army perished because of an epidemic of smallpox. But such an explanation creates more puzzles than it solves. How was it that the whole army was seized by that epidemic just when it was advancing on the Ka'bah? How was it that not a single soldier survived that epidemic? Why was it that no Meccan caught that contagious epidemic? Moreover, if there was no epidemic in Mecca before or after that sudden burst of the plague, where did the epidemic come from?
 
This epoch-making episode happened in 570 A.D. It was in the same year that the Holy Prophet of Islam was born to Abdullah and Amina.

the cave if you sit there you see the Kaaba. 
before the revelation, he began to hear the rocks and stones say salam in his path.  he began having the dream about what would happen the next day. dreams lasted 6 full months. the prophet SAW cut himself from society and worship Allah. AS soon as he received the Revelation he never left the society.

The revelation began on Monday one of the last 10 days of Ramada (Laylatul Qadr).
Why is Jibreel scqeezing him? The guess is to indicate this is real and not a dream, indicating that the message will be heavy, and indicating about three traumatic experiences. 
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>612</b>: Prophet Muhammad sww starts to preach</summary>
 
5 stages of da'wa:
1. Private da'wa (3 years)
2. Open preaching with the tongue without military confrontation (10 years) last 6 were very difficult
3. Open da'wa with the tongue with physical fight only with one party (only QUraish)
4. Open da'wa to all with 'izza. attack only if you need to defence (from treaty of Hudaybia until the conquest of Mecca)
5. Open da'wa along with physical confrontation against anyone who opposes islam.
After receiving a certain ayah, the prophet SAW gathered banu Hashim and made khutbah to them. Abu Lahab opposed saying that we have our fathers ways and who is this man to say the different.
Then the prophet SAW climbed on top of Safa and made the message public. He asked do you trust me and they replied oh yes we havent heard from you any lie. and he said the message to the tribes.
Abu Lahab threw sand in the direction of the prophet SWW. 
Banu Hashim people started to press on Abu Talib to stop his preaching or give him to other tribes. They couldn't touch the prophet Muhammad SWW if Abu Talib doen't give permission. 
Do what you will, my nephew, for Wallahi I will not come to you again to stop your preaching.
All Quraish tribe people came to Abu Talib trying to exchange sons between tribes.
It was the whole Quraish against Abu Talib but he protected the prophet SWW till the last day. However it is believed that he didn't accept islam.
Abu Talib was one of the famous poets of Quraish.

<summary><b>616</b>: Persecution of the first Muslims</summary>

The first person who believed in the Prophet Muhammad was Khadijah. After the prophet sww came home and asked to cover him, he told what happened to Khadijah. She believed that he saw the truth and said that Allah would not let you down.

 ibn Masood was the first to recite the Quran besides the prophet SWW.
abu Jahl, Abu Sufyan listened to recitation secretly in the morning near the house of the prophet SWW.
the most famous poet of Quraish (Bani Maghzum) was Al Walid al Mughira. his vice wa abu Jahl. Al Walid heard the recitation and was mesmerized but Abu Jahl said that there will be no respect from his people until he says something bad about the recitation.
Allah ST send ayahs about Al Walid that we gave him money and many sons
he says there is special type of magic
Three questions:
1. about men in the cave
2. about Dhul Karnain
3. knowledge of the Ruh (no one knows the ruh and you have been given just a little of knowledge)
Abu Jahl is firaun of my ummah. Abu Jahl tortured slaves and boycotted muslim businessmen. 
Ammar, Sumayah, Bilal, Khabbab

 ibm Dagina saw hom migrating and said he will give his protection to Abubakr. he was a chieftan of a neighboring tribe. 

Quraish allowed but said he cannot pray publicly. Abubakr extended his house and begins praying out loud. he actually made a first mesjit.

people would gather around to listen to his recitation.
Quraish said now he cant pray in his house too.
Abubakr gave his protection back to Dagina and chose the protection of Allah.
the migrants came back. 

other Uthman was under protecion of al Walid and he returned it because he felt guilt wihle other muslims were prosecuted.

Emigrants went back to Abyssinia. the Quraish went to najashi with presents and said he must give them the migrants. the Najashi said I will listen to their story. Jagfar and all people came and made his famous speech.

Second wave of migration to Abyssinia around 100 people.

Najashi asked to recite the Revelation. Jagfar recited surah Maryam. 
Najashi was moved and said Im not going to hand these people.
Amr ibm Aws said ask them about what they think about Jesus. Jagfar went to najashi again and said that JesusAS was a righteous prophet. It turned out that najashihasn't believed in trinity.  

There is a narration that after migrating to Medina the prophet SAW wrote najashi inviting him to islam and najashi replied back saying I am a muslim and I believe in you and if you tell me I will come to MEdina and serve you. 

When the najashi died, the prophet gathered people and they prayer janazah. it was the only time janazah praed without a body.

Muslims remiained in Abyssinia 10-11 years. The prophet SAW told them to return only after Badr and some time. Allah knows best but there are reports that the prophet SAW had a backup plan if it doesn't work out in Medina.

<summary><b></b>Conversion of Hamza and Umar</summary>

Hamza converted to islam. one of strangest conversion stories. 

Abu Jahl was cursing the prophet SAW and his fathers. and the woman of Banu Hashim got insulted and women came to Hamza and said what kind of uncle are you, your nephew is insluted and noone defends him. the whole Mecca saw it. Hamza marched to Abu Jahl and smacked him in the face. How dare you insult him I am also following his religion.

Words just came out in anger. Hamza went home and made dua to guide him.

Next morning he came to his nephew and they talked and Hamza converted. and the prophet SAW finally had support from senior of his tribe. and the Quraish had to turn down. 6th year of da'wa. Only after 3 days Umar converted.

ibn Mas'ud said we were never able to pray in the Haram until Umar converted.
the prophet SAW gave him a name al-Faruq after they for the first time went  they all together Haram to pray.

Umar before islam liked to drink. the pubs were closed so he went at night to the Kaaba and he heard the prophet SAW praying in front of the Kaaba and heard the recitation.

So he wanted to beat him but stopped and listened. surah alHaqqa. he was amazed. the meccan surahs are eloqient and powerful. he began to think where is this coming from. thatwas the first time. he went home. 

Abu Jahl promises 100 camels for the one who gets rid of the prophet SAW. Umar decided to do it and took his sword. and Nu'ayn has just converted and asked where are you going so he said have you lost your mind. and if you want to know go fix your own family first. your sister and brother in law just accepted islam. so he marched to his sister house and heard the recitation of the Quran. 

Khabbab was assigned to tech the Quran for Fatima ibn Khattab.

He wanted to punch Said ibn Zays but punched his sister. so he calmed down and asked let me see what you are reading. Umar could read and write. Umar took ghusl and read Ta Ha. he asked wher is the prophet SAW. and he went to the house of al Arkham still had a sword. 
Sahaba saw Umar and scared. Hamza said let him in .

Umar said he came to convert and the prophet SAW said loudly Allahu Akbar. they went together with Hamza Umar and 40 people to pray in Haram.

<summary><b>610</b>: Boycott</summary>
 Amr ibn 'As came from Yemen to mecca, the prophet told him to go back and wait for his victory. then he comes to Medina.

Abu Dharr al-Ghifari came to the Prophet SWW and Abu Bakr showed him the house. The prophet Muhammad sww told him to go back to his tribe and preach the onennes of GOd and doing good deeds and wait until he hears about the victory of Muslims and until then don't tell about your religion here. Abu Dhar goes to Kaaba and proclaims that he is a muslim, then he gets savagely beaten. People stop only after they realize that they will get revenge from Al-Ghifari if he dies.

Abu Dharr comes home and starts to preach. Afte Hijra he comes to Medina with a lot of followers from his tribe.


in the 7th year the Quraish gathered and decided to kill the prophet SAW. 
Abu Talib didnot agree and the boycot started. all marriages with banuHashim were rejected, all business transactions ceized.

Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib went to the valley outside Mecca.
the Quraish wrote the treaty and hanged it inside the Qaaba.

Mut'wa would send food to the valley secretly. also Hakim ibn Hizam would send food.
TDuring the Hajj season the prophet SAW would leave the valley and continue da'wa and tried to find new converts.

Boycott lasted 2 or 3 years. 
There was a severe famine and they realized that this is because of the dua of Muhammad SAW.

a man put camel guts on the prophet SAW when he was praying and Fatima removed them, the prophet SAW made dua against 7 people including Abu Jahl untill their faces turn pale. Abdullah ibn Masood said that he saw all these seven people in the battle of Badr and all of them were dragged to the Pit.

Why Allah ST allowed all these? All prophets and their followers suffered. Allah did not create us for a comfortable life. Your purpose is to earn Allah's mercy to get to Paradise. It is the wisdom of Allah to test us. 
Did mankind think that Allah will leave them without being tested. without being tried.

Khabbab asked the prophet SAW for how long we will endure this.
There were muslims persecuted more than you. The prophet SAW said Allah is going to succeed this religion. A lady shepherd wil take her flock and she will be scared only Allah and wolves.

house of Al Arkham. secret meeting place. near safa beacause many people go there and no suspision is raised. 

At the 5th year of da'wa the prophet SAW said that there's a christian king in Abyssinia who is just and would let you worship Allah without hardship. najashi his name was Akhus smt.
11men and 4 women emigrated. among them was Uthman with Ruqaya, Abdurahman ibn Awf, Abu Salamah, Um Salamah, 
Christians dont have the law because they follow the version of Paul who said that Jesus AS came to abrogate the law. Jesus PBUH never ate pork and lived the life of a jew. 
There were different opinions until Naysean Creed where Constantine decided that christians must believe in the trinity. Aries did not agree with that so Constantine ordered to execute him. he escaped to south all branches of christianity before the naysean creed disappeared.

<summary>Isra 'Al-Miraj </summary>
 isra means travel at night. Al isra- the night journey. Al miraj means the mechanism of rising high. 
miraj is a personal gify to the prophet SAW from Allah ST.
so many narrations about Isra and Miraj. almost half of the hadith from the meccan period are about isra and miraj  
When isra ocurred? Most commentators say a year before Hijrah.
Aisha narrated that Hadija dies before the salah became fard. that means that Miras happened within 1.5 years vefore HIjrah. 
Jibreel came to the prophet SAW and took him to Kaaba. He prayed two raqah then Jibreel opened his chest and washed his heart in a golden bowl inside of which was Zamzam or emaan. probably this was done to prepare the prophet for the isra.
Musa has the second largest ummah after the prophet Muhammad SAW
only two people have titile of halilullah: Ibrahim AS and the prophet Muhammad SAW

Isa told this to the prophets.
Dajjal will come, then Isa AS will come and Dajjal will melt. then people will come to their lands and then Wadjuj and Madjuj will come out and drink all the water. untill Isa AS wil make dua to kill them and they will all die. and the lands will be covered b their bodies. IsaAS will make another dua to get rid of the bodies and Allah will send rain and bodies will be washed away. At this time it will be like a pregnant woman ready to give birth. 
Ibrahim AS said send my salam to your ummah. and tell them I have seem Jannah. its land is fertile but we must plant the plants ourselves every dhikr becomes a tree. in Jannah .
Malik the guardian of hell never smiles even when said salam to the prophet SAW. Jibreel said Were he to have smiled to anybody that would have been you.
The last two verses of surah Al Bakarah were given on the 7th heaven when the prophet SAW was there.
The first thing Allah created is the Pen.
Allah said 50 salah a day. Musa said the the prophet SAW go back to your Lord and ask to reduce the number of prayers. the prophet SAW went up and back 5 or 10 times until it was reduced to 5. So the Voice said it is decreed 5 salah but it will be rewarded with 50.

 Abu Talib dies .

Some people gathered and said we need to gather and stop the boycott. St the same time the prophet saw said Abu talib that the treaty has been eaten by termites. All except bismika.. 
So they opposed Abu jahl

Knowing the truth is not being a Muslim. Being a Muslim means submitting. This is taqwa. There is only one absolute wisdom, and that is the wisdom of Allah ST. And whatever happens we don't question the wisdom of Allah ST. This is what Shaytan did.

Incident of Taif

He SAW comes to tribe's chiefs and they reject his message. then he stays for several days there and preaches. chiefs of Taif send  rif-raffs to throw stones at him so that he goes away. and he SAW goes away under stones. Zayd is shielding him. 
He makes dua telling that it is Allah's right but it would be easier for him than this hardship.  
The prophet SAW performed tahajjud. 
Jinn listened to the prayer and accepted islam. Laylatil jinn. 
The sahabah thought that the prophet SAW was kidnapped and they were worried.
He said: One of the callers of the jinn came to me so I went out to meet with them and recited the Quran.

Suhayb described the place in his house in Mecca where he had left the money, and they allowed him to go. When Suhayb reached Quba, just outside Medina, Muhammad saw him approaching and said, "Your transaction has been fruitful, O Abu Yahya. Your transaction has been fruitful." He repeated this three times. Suhayb's face beamed with happiness as he said: "By God, no one has come before me to you, Messenger of God, and only Jibril could have told you about this."

### 11.1 Major Signs of Al Kiyamah

These signs are connected to each other. When one comes, the other one follows.
There is a hadith that prophet Muhammad saw said, If you encounter the beginning of Al Kiyamah while planting a palm seed, continue planting the seed.

<details>
	<summary><b>Dajjal - the false Messiah or Anti-Christ</b></summary> 
One of Dajjal's eyes will be like a bad grape.
one third of the earth for one year the rain will stop. on the second year 2/3 will be rainless.
Dajjal will pretent that he can resurrect people from the dead but it will be jinns who will imitate people's parents.

Dajjal will be the biggest trial for humankind since they were sent to the Earth. 

In Daniel 8:23-26, Daniel sees a vision of a ram the horns of which grow up to the skies an he doesn't know the interpretation of this vision. So then he sees a man llike looking figure and hears: "Gabriel, tell him the meaning of the vision". Gabriel explains to Daniel that in the latter part of their reign when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue will arise. He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy priests. He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. 
Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.
The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.

Gabriel had such strong impact on Daniel that he had to recover several days.

	<summary><b>The Smoke (Ad-Dukhan)</b></summary> 
The Day of Judgement will not take place until you experience Ad Dukhaw. a smoke that will appear in the sky. you will see it, you will feel it. some hadiths say "dark smoke". it will come into everyone. Smoke will come upon the believers like a flu or cold. and it will come upon non-believers causing disaster death, severe ilness and loding consciousness.

The Smoke is mentioned in the Quran.

	"Then wait for the Day when the sky will bring a visible smoke, covering the people; this is a painful torment. [They will say], ‚ÄúOur Lord, remove from us the torment; indeed, we are believers.‚Äù How can they be reminded when a messenger has already come to them, making things clear."

	<summary><b>What happens after</b></summary> 
Allahu 'Alim.
The Barzak.

The Judgement will not begin until thousands of years people will wait. 

People will come to Adam and ask him to interrogate but he will reject it. and after Nuh, Musa, Isa and some others, people will come to the prophet Muhammad. and he will say that is my task.

There will be pool from Al Kawthar near the prophet Muhammad, and it will be allowed to sincere Muslims to drink from it.
Allah says in the Quran that He has already gifted the prophet Muhammad Al Kawthar, the main river of Jannah. It's water is pure white and whoever drinks for it will not feel thirst for thousands of years.

People will hear Jahannah roar and it will have desire to take the sinners.

People will have their good deeds on the right side and their bad deeds on the left side.

People will have pass through the Sirat bridge above Jahannam. and it will be easy to pass for good people and it will be difficult to pass for bad people and they will fall to Jahannam.

The angel that guards the gates of Heaven will ask: "Who is there?". The prophet Muhammad will reply Muhammad. And malak will say that he is the one for whom the gates must be open. and he will be the first to enter Jannah.

There are several narrations that some of the people who ended up in Jahannam will be allowed to enter Jannah after some time passes and their sins are burned. They will be placed into the river of Jannah where they will regain their shape and start living in Jannah.

Humans are created between angels and animals. Angels dont have their own desires they only worship Allah. and animals are living on their instincts and dont worship Allah as the angels so.
and if human beings incline to instincts, they become worse than animals. and if they incline towards worshipping Allah, they become better than angels.
Adam was the last of Allah's creations.


about 70 years ago there was a consensus in the scientific world that the universe is eternal, which contradicts the Quran that says Allah started the universe. and after 20 years more cosmic data came and scientists accepted that the Big Bang Theory make more sense. 

Arab people didn't even count the years. the calendar was adopted only during the reign of khalif Umar ibn Al Khattab.
