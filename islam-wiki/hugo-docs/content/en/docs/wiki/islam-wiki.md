# 0. Before Creation of Humankind
***************************************

</summary><details><summary>

## In the beginning, there was only Allah ﷻ . 

</summary>

When Prophet Muhammad ﷺ    was asked how this universe started to exist, he said:

كان الله ولم يكن شىء غيره وكان عرشه على الماء وكتب في الذكر كل شىء ثم خلق السماوات والأرض »

Which means: 
>Allāh existed [eternally] and nothing else existed with Him. He created the ^Arsh (Throne) [and placed it] above the water. Then He [ordered the Pen to] write in the (Guarded) Tablet everything that would happen. Then Allāh created the heavens and Earth. [Related by al-Bukhariyy]

The Prophet ﷺ   answered this question by first stating that Allāh's Existence does not have a beginning, i.e., He is Eternal. There is no one attributed with eternity other than Him. In other words, nothing existed eternally except Allāh, and Allāh created everything, i.e., He brought all the creation from non-existence into existence.

</details><details><summary>

## First Creations: Water, Throne, The Pen and The Tablet

</summary>

### Water

Allâh, taâlâ, did not create all the creations at one time. Had He willed for this, it would have occurred. Rather, in six yawm, He created the heavens and Earth ; and for Earth Allāh created rivers, mountains, and valleys. 

The first creation is water. The Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, said:
> « Allāh created everything from water. » [Related by Ibn Hibban]

Allah knows best. This means that Allāh created water before creating light, darkness, Earth, the heavens, the Throne, or the Guarded Tablet. Allāh made water the origin for other creations. He created the Throne from water. Then He created the Upper Pen, then the Guarded Tablet. After these creations, Allāh created the rest of the creations: the Earth, heavens, animals, mountains, trees 🌳, and rivers. Adam, peace be upon him, was of the last kind of creation, humans.

### The Throne

One of the first creations of Allah was the Throne (Al-'Arsh). The Arsh is a platform with pillars. It is considered to be the largest of bodies that Allāh created, and it is the ceiling of Paradise.

There is a Hadith that means the seven heavens in relation to the Kursiyy are like a ring in a very big open space. Likewise, the Kursiyy in relation to the Throne is like a ring in a very big open space. This indicates the huge size of the Throne, which is now carried by four huge angels.

The Quran mentions the throne some 25 times (33 times as Al-'Arsh). 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, said: "Allah created the Throne as an indication of His power, not for taking it as a place for Himself."

### Al-Qalam (The Pen)

‘Ubadah ibn al-Samit reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Verily, the first to be created by Allah was the pen." Sunan al-Tirmidhī 3319 

    Chapter 68 in the Quran is named ‘Al-Qalam’ (the pen). It opens up with the verse: "By the pen and what they inscribe."
    
    In Chapter 96 of the Quran one finds another reference to the high value placed on the might of the pen: "Who taught by the pen. Taught mankind that which he knew not" (96:4-5).

Allah told it to write, so the Pen wrote all that will happen until the Final Hour.

'Pen' is the name of that thing by whose instrumentality Allah has caused the writing on the Tablet. Hence, Allah has ordained the Tablet to serve as an original record, through which the angels, peace be upon them, acquire the knowledge of what is going to happen concerning what is hidden and what is inspired.

### Guarded (Preserved) Tablet

The Preserved Tablet is the record in which Allah The Almighty has recorded the fate of His creatures before He created them. In this regard, the Quran says: 

    "Do you not know that Allaah knows what is in the heaven and earth? Indeed, that is in a Record." Quran 22: 70 

In his interpretation of this verse, Ibn ‘Atiyyah said that the record in this verse refers to the Preserved Tablet. Allah The Almighty also Says (what means): 

    No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a Record before We bring it into being.
    Quran 57: 22

The Maaliki scholar, Al-Qurtubi, may Allah have mercy upon him, mentioned in his interpretation of this verse that the record mentioned here refers to the Preserved Tablet.  

It was narrated in the description of the Guarded Tablet that it is a white pearl and its edge is made of red ruby. Its width is the traveling distance of five hundred (500) years.

Allāh ordered the Pen to write. The Pen wrote, by the Will of Allāh, without anyone holding it. It wrote on the Guarded Tablet what was and what will be in this life until its end. Fifty thousand (50,000) years after this event, Allāh created the heavens and Earth in six (6) yawm. No person is born and no drop of water falls except in accordance to what was written in the Guarded Tablet.

</details><details><summary>

## The Seven Heavens

</summary>

After Allāh created the Earth, He created the seven heavens. Each heaven is a solid body that is held up without any pillars. The heavens are separated. From one heaven to the other is a distance of five hundred (500) years, and every heaven has a gate.

The first heaven is so far away from the Earth. Some people are unable to encompass this to the extent that they believe that the space which contains the stars and planets is the entire universe. They also falsely believe that it extends without an end. There is no point to their claims, because Allāh told us in the Qur’an and the Prophet also informed us in his Hadith what is contradictory to their claims. Paradise exists above the seventh heaven.

</details><details><summary>

## Creation of Angels

</summary>

Allah created angels from nur (luminous light).

One of the Islamic major characteristic of angels their lack of bodily desires: they never get tired, do not eat or drink, and have no anger. As with other monotheistic religions, angels are characteristics of their purity and obedience to God. They have different roles, including their praise of God, interacting with humans in ordinary life, defending against devils and carrying on natural phenomena. Islam acknowledges the concept of angels both as anthropomorphic creatures with wings and abstract forces advising good. Belief in angels is one of the main articles of faith in Islam.

Angels are dwellers of the seven heavens.

### Jibril

<span style="color: green"><b>Jibril</b></span> (Gabriel) or the Ruh is venerated as one of the primary archangels and as the Angel of Revelation in Islam. Jibrīl is regarded as the archangel responsible for revealing the Quran to Muhammad, verse by verse; he is primarily mentioned in the verses 2:97, 2:98, and 66:4 of the Quran, although the Quranic text doesn't explicitly refer to him as an angel. Jibrīl is the angel who communicated with all of the prophets and also descended with the blessings of God during the night of Laylat al-Qadr ("The Night of Divine Destiny (Fate)"). Jibrīl is further acknowledged as a magnificent warrior in Islamic tradition, who led an army of angels into the Battle of Badr and fought against Iblis, when he tempted ʿĪsā (Jesus).

Muslims also revere Gabriel for a number of events predating what they regard as the first revelation, narrated in the Quran. Muslims believe that Gabriel was the angel who informed Zachariah (Zakariyyā) of John's birth, as well as Mary (Maryam) of the future nativity of Jesus; and that Gabriel was one of three angels who had earlier informed Abraham (ʾIbrāhīm) of the birth of Isaac (ʾIsḥāq). Gabriel also makes a famous appearance in the Hadith of Gabriel, in which he questions Muhammad on the core tenets of Islam.

Gabriel in Islam also believed to be the one who delivers punishment from God to the Sodomite by leveling the entire Sodom city with a tip of his wing. According to a Hadith narrated by Abu Dharr al-Ghifari which compiled by al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi, Gabriel has an ability to regulate Feeling or Perception of human, particularly a feel of happiness or sadness.

Accordingly, in Islam, Gabriel is believed to have helped Muhammad overcome his adversaries significantly during the Battle of Badr.

Some mentions of Jibril in the Bible:
* Daniel saw Gabriel.
* Ezekiel saw Gabriel.
* Gabriel came to Zakariyah and tells him that his prayers are heard and that they his wife will give birth to John.

Jibril came to Maryam and told the good news that she will give birth to a child Isa.

Jibril had special relation with the prophet Muhammadﷺ   . In most cases he used to come to the prophet in a human form and give a Revelation or explain religious and worldly matters. Documented occasions when Jibril communicated with the prophet Muhammadﷺ  :
* There is an authentic hadith that when the prophet Muhammadﷺ   was 4-6 years old, Jibril came to him opened up his chest and cleaned his heart in Zamzam water.
* Close to the prophecy times, the prophet Muhammadﷺ   starts to see a man in a dream who later turns out to be Jibril. 
* In the cave of the mount Hira, Jibril comes to the prophet Muhammadﷺ   and says "Iqra!" ("Recite!"). After the prophetﷺ   says that he does not know what to recite, Jibril huggs him tight and transfers the first surah of the Quran. The prophet Muhammadﷺ   was so overwhelmed by this experience, that he hurries back home and asks Hadija to cover him with cloth.

### Other Angels

<span style="color: #08a19a"><b>Mikail</b></span> the archangel of mercy, is often depicted as providing nourishment for bodies and souls while also being responsible for bringing rain and thunder to Earth. Some scholars pointed out that Mikail is in charge of angels who carry the laws of nature.

<span style="color: purple"><b>Israfil</b></span> (frequently associated with the Jewish and Christian angel Raphael), is the archangel who is responsible for signaling the coming of Qiyamah (Judgment Day) by blowing a horn.

<span style="color: blue"><b>Azrail</b></span> is the archangel of death. He and his subordinative angels are responsible for parting the soul from the body of the dead and will carry the believers to Barzakh.

Mentioned in Quran:
* Nāzi'āt and Nāshiṭāt, helpers of Azrail who take the souls of the deceased.
  * **Nāzi'āt**: they are responsible for taking out the souls of disbelievers painfully.
  * **Nāshiṭāt**: they are responsible for taking out the souls of believers peacefully.
* Hafaza, (The Guardian angel):
  * **Kiraman Katibin** (Honourable Recorders), two of whom are charged to every human being; one writes down good deeds and another one writes down evil deeds. They are both described as 'Raqeebun 'Ateed' in the Qur'an.
  * **Mu'aqqibat** (The Protectors) who keep people from death until its decreed time and who bring down blessings.
* Angels of Hell:
  * <span style="color: orange">Maalik</span>, Chief of the angels who govern Jahannam (Hell).
  * Nineteen angels of hell, commanding the Zabaniyya, to torment sinful people in hell.
* Those angels who distribute provisions, rain, and other blessings by God's Command.
* Those angels who drive the clouds.
* **Cherubim**, who are close to God and request forgiveness for the sinners.
* **Hamalat al-'Arsh**, those who carry the 'Arsh (Throne of God), comparable to the Christian Seraph.
* **Harut** and **Marut**, often depicted as angels who taught the humans in Babylon magic; mentioned in Quran (2:102).

Also, there is a hadith about **Munkar** and **Nakir**, two angels that question the souls of people in the grave after they die. For details, see [#barzakh](#barzakh).

## Creation of Heaven and Hell

</summary>

Jannah (Paradise) and Jahannam (Hell) were created before its future habitats. This means Hell and Heaven already exist now.

Al-'Aqeedah al-Salafiyyah by at-Tahhaawi:

"Paradise and Hell have already been created. They will never come to an end or cease to exist. Allah ﷻ  created Paradise and Hell before the rest of creation, and He ﷻ  created inhabitants for each of them. Whoever He  ﷻ wishes (will enter) Paradise by His grace and mercy, and whoever He  ﷻ wishes (will enter Hell) as a result of His justice. Every person will behave according to that for which he was created, and his destiny will be that for which he was created; good deeds and evil deeds are foreordained for all men".

> Abu Hurairah [ra] narrated that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   said:
> "When Allah created Jannah and Hellfire, He sent Gabriel to Jannah, saying, ‘look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.’ 
> 
> So Gabriel went to it and looked at it and at what Allah had prepared therein for its inhabitants. Then Gabriel returned to Allah and said, ‘By Your glory, no one hears of it without entering it.’ 
> 
> So Allah ordered that it be encompassed by forms of hardship, and
> He said, ‘Return to it and look at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants! So, Gabriel returned to it and found that it was surrounded by forms of hardship. Then he returned to Allah and said, ‘By Your glory, I fear that no one will enter it, Allah said, ‘Go to Hellfire and look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its inhabitants.’ Gabriel found that it was in layers, one above the other.
> Then Gabriel returned to Allah and said, ‘By Your glory, no one who hears of it will enter it.’ 
> 
> So Allah ordered that it be surrounded by lusts. Then He said, ‘Return to it and Gabriel returned to it and said, ‘By Your glory, I am frightened that no one will escape from entering it.’
> [at-Tirmidhi, abu Dawud and An-Nasa'i]

### Concept of Jannah and Jahannam

</summary>
Partly From the narration of Malik ibn Dinar and his daughter who hushed away the dragon that was chasing her father. we can derive that good deeds and sins of people are some physical entities in another dimension. Somehow these entities are combined for your punishment or your blessing in the hereafter.

For example, there is a hadith that says each dhikr is a real seed of your tree 🌳 in Jannah. 

Every person is only getting the result of what he has done in this dunya. His own punishment is build from his sins which with the design of Allah ﷻ obtained a certain form in Jahannam. Jahannam is designed in a way that collects all your sins and bestows upon you if Allah ﷻ  does not grant you of His mercy.

</details><details id="level2"><summary>

### Reality of Jahannam

</summary>

According to the Quran and ahadith, Jahannam seem to be a living creature that breathes, roars and has a natural desire to punish the transgressors and disbelievers.

Easy Entrance: “Paradise is surrounded by difficulties and Fire is surrounded by temptations” [Bukhari].

Eternal: "O Jannatis, now there will be no death; O Jahannamis now there will be no death; On hearing this call, the Jannatis will be delighted and the Jahanamis will become more depressed." [Bukhari] 

Depth: "If a rock is dropped into Jahannam, it will remain plummeting for 70 years before touching the pith of Jahannam". [Muslim]

4 Walls: "Four walls surround Jahannam. The width of each wall is a walking distance of 40 years". 

7 Gates: "Jahannam has seven gates; one of them is for the one who unsheathes a sword against my Ummah." [Mishkat] 

Atmosphere: “Jahannam was heated for a thousand years and its fire turned red; It was then heated for another thousand years and it became white; it was again heated for another thousand years and it turned black. At present, Jahannam is pitch black and dark." [Tirmidhi] "The fire in which one will burn is the 70th part of the Fire of Jahannam.” [Muslim]

7 Layers: Ali ibn Abi Talib (ra) has said that the gates of Jahannam are one upon each other. This denotes that Jahannam has layers. "The Hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire." [Qur'an 4:145]. 

Hutama: According to some narrations, the deepest level of the Hells. It is for the Hypocrites (Munafiqin).

### Jannah -- The Paradise

</summary>

Jannah is above the seven heavens.

Jannah is very big.

Jannah is very beautiful.

Jannah has many trees 🌳🌳, rivers, and birds 🐦🐦🐦 with beautiful sounds. It has all what one would like. Allāh created Adam in Paradise.

The Quran describes Paradise as a garden with flowing water, rising from springs and fountains (Q88:10|88:10), trees with unceasing supply of fruits grow.  Four rivers provide four different drinking substances, which are water, milk, honey, and wine (47:15), while wine in paradise doesn't intoxicate (52:23).  Physical pleasures are understood to appeal to humans. In paradise, humans will still be humans, not turn to angels. 

Each person that goes to Jannah is greeted by angels from every gate with the words, "Peace be upon you, because ye have endured with patience; how excellent a reward is paradise!" (Q13:24) Each person lives near to the Lord in a garden (3:15) of perpetual bliss (13:23). In paradise, people would have "whatever they wish for" (Q25:16).  In each garden is a mansion (9:72), a high throne (88:10–16) of dignity (52:20) in a grove of cool shade (36:56–57), an adorned couch (18:31), rows of cushions, rich carpets spread out, a cup (Q88:10–16) full of wine (52:23), and every meat (52:22) and fruit (Q36:56–57) that is like the food on Earth (Q2:25). Each person is adorned in golden and pearl bracelets (Q35:33) and green garments of fine silk and brocade (Q18:31).

Both men and women will have beautiful and pure spouses (Q2:25, Q4:57), accompanied by any children that did not go to Jahannam (Q52:21), and attended to by servant-boys with the spotless appearance similar to a protected pearls (Q52:24). The Believers Men will get untouched (Q55:56) virgin companions of equal age (56:35-38) and have large, beautiful eyes (37:48).

Jannah is described as an eternal dwelling (Q3:136), with its supreme felicity and greatest bliss being God's good pleasure (Q9:72).

## Creation of the Heavens and the Earth 🌍

</summary>

The Qur'an says that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one "unit of creation", after which they were "cloven asunder".

    The heavens and the earth were joined together as one unit, before We clove them asunder 
    Quran (21:30)

Following this big explosion 💥, the heavens and the earth came into their present shape after going through a phase when they were smoke-like.

    Then He turned to the heaven while it was smoke. He said to the heaven and the earth: "Come (into being), willingly or unwillingly." They said: "We come willingly."
    Quran 41:11 (Surah Fussilat)

The Qur'an states that "Allah created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, in six youm(يوم))" (7:54). While on the surface this might seem similar to the account related in the Bible, there are some important distinctions.

The verses that mention "six days" use the Arabic word "youm" (day). This word appears several other times in the Qur'an, each denoting a different measurement of time. In one case, the measure of a day is equated with 50,000 years (70:4), whereas another verse states that `a day in the sight of your Lord is like 1,000 years of your reckoning` (22:47). The word "youm" is thus understood, within the Qur'an, to be a long period of time -- an era or eon. Therefore, Muslims interpret the description of a "six day" creation as six distinct periods or eons. The length of these periods is not precisely defined, nor are the specific developments that took place during each period.

Thus the elements and what was to become the planets and stars began to cool, come together, and form into shape, following the natural laws that Allah established in the universe.

The Qur'an further states that Allah created the sun, the moon, and the planets, each with their own individual courses or orbits. 

    "It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course" (21:33).
    
    "The heavens, We have built them with power. And verily, We are expanding it" (51:47)

There has been some historical debate among Muslim scholars about the precise meaning of this verse, since knowledge of the universe's expansion was only recently discovered. In the beginning of 20th century, the consensus among scientists was that the universe is static. So, the science was contradicting the Quran until Einstein discovered the theory of relativity.

</details><details><summary>

## Big Bang Scientific Side-Note

</summary>

    13.8 billion years ago: the Universe started to expand.
    4.56 billion years ago: the Earth appeared.
    4.51 billion years ago: the Moon 🌙 appeared. 
    3.5 billion years ago: Life on Earth began.
    600 million years ago: Animals appeared.
    245-66 million years ago: 🦖 🦕​ Dinosaurs!! And also crocodiles and cockroaches!!
    ~200.000 years ago: Modern Homo-Sapiens appeared. Scientific Adam and mithochondrial Eve is estimated by geneologists 140-200k years ago.

    Evolution changed the shape of all animals on Earth but Adam and Eve were created by Allah directly. And after the first humans Adam and Eve were created, evolution continued to affect them because it is in their genes. Humans have bodies of Homo-Sapiens but not only the body defines a human. 

Before 19th century there was a scientific consensus that the Universe 🌌 is static. But after Einstein's Theory of Relativity, science stated that the Universe is expanding. So, until 19XX science contradicted the Quran. 
100 years ago, the world’s best scientific minds thought that the universe had always existed. Since it always existed, it didn’t need a Creator.

Einstein changed all that.

Einstein's ‘field equations’ suggested that the universe was expanding like a balloon. The mathematician and Belgian Priest, George Lemaître, realised that this expansion had to have started from somewhere. It must have come from an initial, dense point. This idea became known as the Big Bang. Today, it is the basis for understanding the origin of the universe.

What few people know however is that the Holy Quran described the Big Bang perfectly, 1400 years earlier.

    "Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were a closed-up mass (ratqan), then We opened them out? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" 
    Quran, 21:31

The arabic word ratqan means a closed-up mass. It also means darkness. A dark, closed-up mass is a perfect description of what we know the universe looked like in its earliest moments. The heavens and the Earth were indeed opened out from this mass to produce the universe we see today.

The verse further says that water is the basis of life. This is now an accepted scientific fact. When NASA look for planets that can bear life, they look for water.

For many centuries the Quran contradicted the established opinion of scientists who thought that the universe was static. 

Einstein’s equations tell us that the universe is expanding. This discovery surprised everyone.

For decades thereafter, scientists thought the universe exploded out of the Big Bang, and has been slowing down ever since. But they were wrong. The universe’s expansion has recently been speeding up. This mysterious re-expansion is driven by what we call dark energy. About 5 billion years ago, this mysterious anti-gravity began pushing the universe outwards once more.

The Holy Quran describes this perfectly:

    "And We have built the heaven with might and We continue to expand it indeed."
    Quran 51:48

This verse does not just tell us that the universe has expanded. The arabic ‘la-mūsiʿūna’ tells us that the universe is continuing to expand.

## Creatures Living on Earth

</summary>

    Allah  ﷻ  created the Heavens and the Earth and all kinds of beasts. 
    The Quran, surah Lukman

After completing the Creation, the Qur'an describes that Allah "settled Himself upon the Throne" (57:4) to oversee His work. A distinct point is made to counter the Biblical idea of a day of rest: "We created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six youm, nor did any sense of weariness touch Us" (50:38).

Allah  ﷻ is never "done" with His work, because the process of creation is ongoing. Each new child who is born, every seed that sprouts into a sapling, every new species that appears on earth, is part of the ongoing process of Allah's creation. 

    "He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in six youm, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters within the heart of the earth, and what comes forth out of it, what comes down from heaven, and what mounts up to it. And He is with you wherever you may be. And Allah sees well all that you do" (57:4).

There are many types of creatures living on earth, including plants, animals, insects, all kinds of microorganisms, human. There are also creature that are not visible for a human eye: the jinn.

## Era of Jinns (Devils/Spirits)

</summary>

> [short version]
> Allah ﷻ  created jinns from fire.
> The community of the jinn race were like those of humans, but then corruption and injustice among them increased and all warnings sent by God were ignored. Consequently, God sent his angels to battle the infidel jinn. Only a few jinn survived, and were ousted to far islands or to the mountains. With the revelation of Islam, the jinn were given a new chance to access salvation. However, because of their prior creation, the jinn would attribute themselves to a superiority over humans and envy them for their place and rank on earth.
> Jinn can be bad and they also can be good and righteous jinn who worship God alone.
> Jinn are able to see humans, humans are not able to see the jinn. There is a rule for the jinn not to cross the barrier between their world and human world, and the tresspassers will be asked for it.

### Who are the Jinn?

Allah created jinns from smokeless fire 🔥, the edge of the flame. Jinns live in the same earth as we do but they are hidden from our sight. Humans cannot see jinns, jinns can see humans but they cannot see angels.

The lives of jinn are very similar to the humans, they eat, they drink, they marry, they have their children, and even they are instructed and guided the same way as humans. We can understand this statement by the following verse of Surah Al-An’am.

    "O company of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves"; and the worldly life had deluded them, and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers. 
    Quran [6:130]

This verse shows that messengers were not only sent down to guide the humans but they were sent down to guide both the humans and jinn.

Jinns have males and females, they have different religions, tribes, nations.
The jinn live in the parallel world to the humans and since they live in the different dimension the flow of time there is different too. Hence, the lifespan of jinn is different and believed to be much longer than the human lifespan.

Jinns are the only creatures besides human beings that have a free will and they will be judged according to their deeds.

Jinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the Quran.

    "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."
    Quran, Surah Al-Dhariyat ayah 56

The above verse shows the same core purpose of life for both the humans and the jinn. Their purpose of life is not very different from the humans as they are ordered by Allah to do the same good deeds as humans do and they are supposed to obey and worship one and only God “Allah”. Like in humans there are two broader categories, Muslims and Non-Muslims, similarly in jinn there are the same two main divisions (the Muslims and Non-Muslims).

They have the power to choose between true and false, right and wrong as Allah said in sura al-Jinn verse 11: 

    And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.
    Quran, Surah Al-Jinn 72:11

### ⚔️ War Between Jinn and Angels

[Most of information in this section cannot be found in the Quran and the Sunnah. But it is derived from early interpretators of the Quran, including sahaba.]

The jinn started living on the earth before humans and they didn't behave good and didn't treat the creatures on the earth in a good manner.

Satan or Iblis is one of the first jinns. He was the best among the jinn and he was even raised to the rank of angels. But there was evil in his heart and he wanted to rule his own kingdom. He asked Allah to send him and some angels to destroy the transgressing jinn on the earth and Allah gave the permission.

After the battle there were only a small amount of jinn left here and there.

### Disobedience of Iblis (Satan)

Iblis wanted his own Kingdom, and Allah wanted to test him.

Allah said that He will create a new creation -- Adam -- and make him the khalifa on earth. Allah told angels and Iblis to prostrate before Adam. Iblis refused to prostrate because of his arrogance. So Allah banished Iblis from heaven but Iblis asked for respite until humans are resurrected and he was granted respite.

Satan disobeyed God and promised that he will lead humankind astray. 

    I will come from in front of them and I will come from behind them, from their right and their left; nor will you find that most of them are grateful." except for those of them who were righteous.

### Shaytan are Enemies to Humans

Iblis tricked Adam and Eve and managed to get them out of Heaven. He made himself many followers among jinn. So they all started leading descendands of Adam astray. This special type of jinn are called shayatin (devils). According to most sources, After Satan disobeyed Allah and vowed to lead humans astray, some jinns followed Satan, and they became shayatin, whose job is to lead people astray. and when a person is born, a shayatin is assigned to follow this person every day and whisper bad thoughts.

Each person has a shaytan (or a bad jinn) assigned to follow him anywhere and misguide him and lead him astray so that he forgets about Allah, does not repent for his sins and eventually ends up in hell.

Allah has already made us aware of this in the Surah Al-Araf, verse 27:

    “O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe”.

The above verse states that jinn have the power to see humans and to take possessions on the humans. The only way to keep ourselves safe from the evil beings is to pray five times, to walk on the path which Allah and His messenger (P.B.U.H) has shown us, and to follow the teaching of Quran, Sunnah, and Hadith.

The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Allah, may He be blessed and exalted, says: ‘I created all of My slaves as hunafa’ (sing. haneef, i.e., believing in monotheism), but the devils diverted them from their belief.’” End quote from Ta’weel Mukhtalaf al-Hadith.

### Suleyman (Solomon) Had Power Over Jinn

In the story of Solomon jinns appear as nature spirits comparable to Talmudic shedim. Solomon was gifted by God to talk to animals and spirits. God granted him authority over the rebellious jinn and devils forcing them to build the First Temple in Jerusalem.

In addition, the Qur’an also mentions Ifrit in sura al-Naml (The Ant) verse 39.
Ifrit who brought Suleiman smo's throne.

The Qur'an relates that Solomon died while he was leaning on his staff. As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them, so they continued to work. They realized the truth only when Allah sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon's staff until his body collapsed. The Qurʾan then comments that if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the humiliating torment of being enslaved.

    "Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the jinn saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating penalty (of their task)." 
    Qur'an 34:14

### Jinn and Magic

In other instances, the Quran tells about Pagan Arabs, calling jinn for help, instead of God. The Quran reduced the status of jinn from that of tutelary deities to that of minor spirits, usually paralleling humans.

    And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, "We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic]." 

    And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew.
    Quran, Surah Al-Baqara 2:102

### Jinns flying to heavens

Before the revelation of the Quran, the Jinn were allowed to enter heavens to listen to angels. This was the way they could tell what's is decreed in some acpects of this dunya. After the first surah of the Quran came to the prophet Muhammad (pbuh), some obstacle appeared between jinn and heavens so they could not tresspass it no more.

    "And we have sought [to reach] the heaven but found it filled with powerful guards and burning flames."
    Quran, Surah Al-Jinn 72:8

### Prophet Muhammad Talked to Jinns

In Islamic tradition, Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and that prophets and messengers were sent to both communities. Traditionally, the 72nd surah, Al-Jinn, named after them, is held to tell about the revelation to jinn and several stories mention one of Muhammad's followers accompanied him, witnessing the revelation to the jinn.

At the time of Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H), a group of jinn were turned into Muslims when they heard the recitation of Holy Quran. At that time Allah revealed the following verses of Surah Jinn on Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H),

    Say, [O Muhammad], "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.'" 
    Quran 72:1-2

### The Shaitan

Iblis was amongst the best of jinn. some narrations say he worshipped Allah in all of the heavens and he was raised almost to the rank of angels. Then he came to Allah and asked to send him and some angels to punish the transgressing jinn who were living on the earth. So they started destroying the jinn that lived on earth only a scarce amount of them remained here and there. and Allah knew that Iblis wants his own kingdom for himself. so He created Adam to test Iblis, to reveal his intentions. And He asked angels and IBlis to bow before Adam which he disobeyed refused to do.  

    "Will you o human beings take him and his children as allies while he is your enemy."
    Surah 18:50

Shaitan has children. 
Shaitan uses waswasa to influence humans. And the waswasa does not work on devout worshippers of Allah.

### Classification of Jinn

According to Arabic linguists there are different categories of jinn: 

1. jinni, in general terms. 
2. Amir or dweller if the jinn lives in houses with people 
3. Arwah or spirits who interact with children. 
4. Shaytan or Satan if the jinn is wicked.
5. if he is worse than that, called marid or demon. 
6. Ifrit, if he is worse than that and strong (al-Shibli, 1985). 

In general, the pagan believe that jinn have hidden powers, giving some benefit and harassment. As Allah says in Sura Saba’ verse 41:

    They will say, "Exalted are You! You, [O Allah], are our benefactor not them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them."

Similarly in Sura al-Jinn verse 6, Allah explains that most pagan seek help and protection to jinn. In view of them there is collaboration between man and poets of jinn which they can produce beautiful poetry to listen to (Shihab, 2002)

### Demons in Christianity

Modern Christian view on jinn is a little different than the Islamic view. In modern Christian tradition, demons are fallen angels and have the same characteristics as their good angel counterparts: spirituality, immutability and immortality. Demons are not omniscient, but each one has a specific knowledge (sometimes on more than one subject). Their power is limited to that which God allows, so they are not omnipotent.

Christian demonology states that the mission of the demons is to induce humans to sin. Demons are also believed to try to tempt people into abandoning the faith, committing heresy or apostasy, remaining or turning into Pagans, or venerating idols (the Christian term for cult images). It is also believed that demons torment people during their life or through demonic possession or simply by showing themselves before persons to frighten them or by provoking visions that could induce people to sin or to be afraid.

Demons can take any desired appearance, even that of an "angel of light".

The Devil has been popularly symbolized as various animals, including the serpent 🐍, the goat and the dragon.

The idea that demons have horns seems to have been taken from chapter 13 of the Book of Revelation. This idea has also been associated with the depiction of certain ancient gods like Moloch and the shedu, etc., which were portrayed as bulls, as men with the head of a bull, or wearing bull horns as a crown.

### Shedim in Judaism

Shedim (Hebrew: שֵׁדִים; singular: שֵׁד Shed) are spirits or demons in the Tanakh and Jewish tradition. However, they are not necessarily equivalent to the modern connotation of demons as evil entities.

They appear only twice (always plural) in the Tanakh, at Psalm 106:37 and Deuteronomy 32:17. Both times it deals with child or animal sacrifices. Although the word is traditionally derived from the root šwd (Hebrew: שוד shûd) that conveys the meaning of "acting with violence" or "laying waste," it was possibly a loan-word from Akkadian in which the word shedu referred to a spirit which could be either protective or malevolent. With the translation of Hebrew texts into Greek, under influence of Zoroastrian dualism, shedim were translated into daimonia with implicit negativity. Otherwise, later in Judeo-Islamic culture, shedim became the Hebrew word for Jinn with a morally ambivalent attitude.

> 35. And they mingled with the nations and learned their deeds. 36. They worshipped their idols, which became a snare for them. 37. They slaughtered their sons and daughters to the demons [shedim]. 38. They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters whom they slaughtered to the idols of Canaan, and the land became polluted with the blood. 39. And they became unclean through their deeds, and they went astray with their acts.
>Tehillim (Psalms), 106.35-39

>17. They sacrificed to demons [shedim], which have no power, deities they did not know, new things that only recently came, which your forefathers did not fear.
> Devarim (Deuteronomy), 32.17

According to one legend, the shedim are descendants of serpents 🐍, or of demons in the form of serpents, alluding to the serpent in Eden as related in Genesis.

The people who build the Tower of Babel were divided by their motivations into three groups. Those who wished to wage war against God were transformed into shedim.

The Talmud describes the shedim as possessing some traits of angels, and some traits of humans:

>In three ways they are like ministering angels: They have wings like ministering angels; and they fly from one end of the world to the other like ministering angels; and they know what will be in the future like ministering angels. And in three ways they are similar to humans: They eat and drink like humans; they multiply like humans; and they die like humans.
>Babylonian Talmud Hagigah 16a

The shedim are not always seen as malicious creatures and are also considered to be helpful to humans. They are said to be even able to live according to the Torah, like Asmodeus.

Conjuring shedim isn't necessarily forbidden, depending on whether or not, author's view summoning them as sorcery or not. Even if summoning shedim is an act of sorcery and thus forbidden, consulting shedim conjured by a non-Jew would be permissible.

Shedim can shapeshift and assume a human form. The Talmud tells of Asmodeus assuming King Solomon's form and ruling in his place for some time. However, he was never seen barefoot because he could not disguise his feet.

# 1. Adam and Eve
*******************************************

<details><summary>

## Adam is created from clay

</summary>

According to Quranic creation narrative, Godﷻ   informed angels that He was going to create a khalifa (vicegerent) on earth. 

    And mention [O Muhammad], when your Lord said to the angels, "Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority." They said, "Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You?" Allah said, "Indeed, I know that which you do not know." 
    Quran (2:30)

While Islam recognizes the general idea of the development of life in stages, over a period of time, human beings are considered as a special act of creation. Islam teaches that human beings are a unique life form that was created by Allah in a special way, with unique gifts and abilities unlike any other: a soul and conscience, knowledge, and free will. In short, Muslims do not believe that human beings randomly evolved from apes🐒. The life of human beings began with the creation of two people, a male and a female named Adam and Hawwa (Eve).

The Qur'an describes how Allah created Adam.

    "We created man from sounding clay, from mud moulded into shape..." 
    (Quran 15:26)
    
    "He began the creation of man from clay, and made his progeny from a quintessence of fluid"
    (Quran 32:7-8) 

According to a hadith, Allah created the body of Adam and it lay still for some time. During that time Iblis went through Adam's body and got thoughts that he will be able to control Adam because his body was hollow.

Then, Allahﷻ   breathed a soul into Adam.

There is a hadith from Abu Huraira 🐈: 

    When Allah breathed a soul into Adam, Adam sneezed and said "Alhamdulillah!" (Praise to God!). Allah replied "Yarmukallah, o Adam (Let God give you of His Mercy!). Go to those angels that sit in the gathering and say to them "Assalamu Aleykum!" (Peace be upon you). Angels replied "Waaleykum Assalam wa Rahmatullah (And peace to you and mercy)!" 
    When Adam returned to his Lord, He said: "Indeed, this will be your greeting, and greeting of your sons among each other".

    The hadith further says that then Allah opened His hand and showed Adam all of his descendands. Each person had his life expectancy written on his forehead. Adam saw a man whose light was one of the brightest and he asked "Who is this man?". Allah replied "This is Dawud (David) and he is prescribed to live 40 years". Adam said "Oh my Lord, extend his life", Allah replied "This is the term I prescribed him". Adam asked again "Oh my Lord, I give him 60 of my years" for which Allah replied "Let it be your way".
    Sheikh Al-Albani called this hadith authentic.

Allah gave Adam knowledge and taught him names. One of the version of interpretation is that Adam was taught the names of animals and birds 🐦. The other version is that he was taught speech.

### Every human souls testifies in front of God

Angels asked Allah why He want to send to Earth humans knowing that they will transgress. Allahﷻ   told angels that He knows what they know not.

And Allahﷻ   made all children of Adam as souls to testify that their Lord is Allah.

    And ˹remember˺ when your Lord brought forth from the loins of the children of Adam their descendants and had them testify regarding themselves. ˹Allah asked,˺ "Am I not your Lord?" They replied, "Yes, You are! We testify." ˹He cautioned,˺ "Now you have no right to say on Judgment Day, "We were of this unaware."
    Quran, surah Al-A'raf (The Heights)

It is the fitrah (natural inclination/sound human nature) which is instilled in our souls and hearts, that drives us to believe in Allah and long to know Him, may He be glorified. In fact, it reaches the level of urgency that pushes and compels us to acknowledge that the Creator, may He be glorified and exalted, is the only, perfect Lord Who bestows His blessings upon us and upon all other created beings.

This spiritual and rational urge (to believe in Allah) is the strongest factor that prompts man to believe in Allah and affirm His Oneness, because it is usually stronger than any other impulses that may lead man to fall into ignorance and doubt. Often this urge (to believe) may overwhelm a person and make him realise the belief in divine Oneness (Tawheed) deep in his heart at times of crisis and calamity, even if the one who still has that sound natural inclination (fitrah) is pretending today to be an atheist. The call of Tawheed is still urging him from deep inside to believe, because of this natural inclination (fitrah) which is the first covenant taken from the sons of Adam.

### Characteristics of Adam

According to hadith:
* Adam was eloquent.
* He had a beautiful voice.
* The prophet Adam used to talk with his children with clear words and not with signs.
* The prophet Adam knew all the names of the creations such as the name of the sky, the earth, the sea, the air, the angel, the jinn, and the like.
* The prophet Adam Plants and Harvests.
* Allāh created in our master Adam the knowledge of the matters of earning a living.
* Allāh created in Adam the knowledge of how to plant seeds, vegetables, and fruits, and how to harvest.
* There is a narration that Adam Alayhissalam was the first to build the first place of worship -- The Kaabah.

</details><details><summary>

## Iblis (Satan) refused to bow down to Adam

</summary>

Iblis wanted to rule over his own kingdom and kept it to himself. Allah wanted to reveal his dark thoughts, so He created Adam. The Qur’an tells the story of Iblis several different times, each time offering different facets of the story.

    We created you, We formed you; and then We commanded the angels, "bow down before Adam," and they bowed. But not Iblis; he refused to be one of those who bow.
      
    God said: "What prevented you from bowing down as I commanded you?" And he [Iblis] said: "I am better than he: You created me from fire and him from clay."
      
    God said: "Get down from here! Here is no place for your arrogance, Get out! You are the lowest of creatures!"
    but Iblis said, "Give me respite until the day they are raised."
    and God said, "You have respite."

    And then Iblis said, "Because you have put me in the wrong, I shall lie in wait for them on Your straight path; I will come from in front of them and I will come from behind them, from their right and their left; nor will you find that most of them are grateful." except for those of them who were righteous.

    God said, "Get out! You are disgraced and expelled! I swear I shall fill Hell with you and all who follow you."
    Quran, Surah 7

</details><details><summary>

## Creation of Hawwah (Eve)

</summary>
Adam’s spouse, although commonly referred to as Eve or Hawa, is not mentioned by name in the Quran despite being referred to in many places. The details regarding how Eve was created are not mentioned in the Quran. However, it is made evident that Eve was created from Adam.

While the creation of Eve is not described in detail, the Qur'an does make it clear that a "mate" was created with Adam, from the same nature and soul. 

    It is He Who created you from a single person, and made his mate of like nature, in order that he might dwell with her in love (7:189). 

She is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but in Islamic tradition she is known as "Hawwa" (Eve).

From these two individuals, generations of human beings have inhabited the earth. 

    "Oh humankind! We created you from a single pair of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, so that you may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honored among you in the sight of Allah is the who is the most righteous of you. And Allah has full knowledge and is well acquainted (with all things)" 
    Quran [49:13]
    
    "O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women…." 
    Quran [4:1]

The hadith or traditions of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) further reveal that Eve was created from Adam’s rib which was taken while he was asleep. The narrations that describe this story of the rib is often used to emphasize being gentle and kind to women. 

“O Muslims! I advise you to be gentle with women, for they are created from a rib, and the most crooked portion of the rib is its upper part. If you try to straighten it, it will break, and if you leave it, it will remain crooked; so I urge you to take care of the women.” [Sahih al-Bukhari 5185; Sahih Muslim 8:3468]

### Adam and Eve are placed in Paradise
After Eve was created, the couple was given a place in heaven.

    And We said, "O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat therefrom in [ease and] abundance from wherever you will. But do not approach this tree 🌳, lest you be among the wrongdoers." 
    Quran [2:35]

Eve was created to accompany Adam as his companion and life partner, and they were instructed to live together in tranquility. In heaven, Adam and Eve were free to eat and enjoy everything with the exception of one tree 🌳. 

The Quran does not describe what kind of tree it was, however, this prohibition set the stage for the test that was to come.

</details><details><summary>

## Eating from Forbidden Tree 🚻 🐍 🌳 🍎

</summary>

> Satan tempted Adam and Eve by whispering. Adam and Hawwa disobeyed Allah and ate from the forbidden tree. They asked for forgiveness and Allah forgave them. And they were sent to live on the Earth.

In the Quran, the forbidden tree served as a test for Adam and Eve. Furthermore, God warned Adam and Eve that the devil was an enemy and that they should be on their guard. 

    So We said, "O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife. Then let him not remove you from Paradise so you would suffer." 
    Quran [20:117]

Satan, eagerly targeting the weakness of mankind, tempted Adam and Eve by whispering into their hearts. Claiming to be a sincere advisor, he planted in their minds ideas that would make the forbidden tree appealing. Thoughts of the tree preoccupied both Adam and Eve. Forgetting the warning, they gave in and erred.

    But Satan whispered to them to make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts. He said, "Your Lord did not forbid you this tree 🌳 except that you become angels or become of the immortal." 

    And he swore [by Allah ] to them, "Indeed, I am to you from among the sincere advisors." 
      
    So he made them fall, through deception. And when they tasted of the tree, their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called to them, "Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is to you a clear enemy?" 
    Quran [7:20-22]

By forgetting God’s command, Adam and Eve bore equal responsibility for their error. This too was a test for Satan, who in fact, furthered his disobedience by exploiting mankind through their desires. 

</details><details><summary>

## Repentance of Adam and Eve

</summary>

Through this test, God prepared Adam for his role on earth, as a caretaker and a Prophet. This experience taught Adam firsthand that Satan was a deceptive enemy to mankind. 

After eating from the tree, Adam and Eve became ashamed and deeply regretted their actions. They acknowledged their errors and sought mercy, repenting sincerely.

    "Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers."
    Quran [7:23]

The story of Adam and Eve in the Quran teaches the virtue of repentance and supplication. Adam and Eve recognized their errors and prayed for forgiveness. This, in turn, earned them Allah’s forgiveness and guidance.

    "Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided [him]." 
    Quran [20:122]

</details><details><summary>

## Adam and Eve are sent to Earth

</summary>

In the Quran, God consoles Adam. Since the sin of Adam stemmed from desire, and not from arrogance, his repentance was accepted. 

    “Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful.” 
    Quran [2:37]

Despite being forgiven, Adam and Eve were no longer granted the comforts of paradise and would be sent to Earth. It is important to note that since Allah had mentioned Adam’s mission on Earth long before his test, Adam and Eve’s appointment to earth is not viewed as punishment, instead, it aligns with God’s Plan. The Quran describes the Earth to Adam and Eve as a place in which to reside and enjoy for a period of time, until the day they die and are resurrected (Quran 7:24-25). 

    We said, "Go down from it, all of you. And when guidance comes to you from Me, whoever follows My guidance – there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs – those will be companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally." 
    Quran [2:38-39]

Furthermore, Adam is informed by God that he and his progeny will be sent guidance during their time on Earth. In contrast, Satan, unlike Adam, had not begged for forgiveness and had instead requested respite: a chance to mislead and reveal the inadequacy of mankind. God facilitated this request, but warned that Satan would be powerless over the believers. 

Therefore, in the Quran, Adam, Eve, and Satan are all sent down to Earth. On Earth, Adam (pbuh) assumes the role as the first Prophet and the father of mankind. 

There is a difference of opinions on the question of where Adam and Eve landed on earth. The majority of tabi'un and sahabi said that Adam came from the Heavens to the land oh Hind (modern day India). Other opinions include taht he landed in Mecca or in Sri-Lanka. When it comes to Hawwah, some say that she came with Adam to Mecca, some say to India with Adam, and most say that she came in Jedda. The place where they came down is not mentioned in the Quran and ahadith, thus these are only presumptions.

# 2. Early Human Era on Earth

## Children of Adam and Eve

</summary>
Adam and Eve were descended from Heaven and they began their life on earth. Allah had prepared them in many ways. Allah gave them the experience of struggling against whisperings and tricks of shaytan. He taugh Adam the names of certain things and instructed in its properties and usefulness. Adam took his position as a caretaker of the earth.

Adam (as) was the first prophet of God, who was responsible for teaching his wife and children how to worship Allah (swt) and seek his forgiveness. Adam established the laws of God and set about trying to support his family and learning to subdue and care for the earth. His task was to raise children, cultivate, construct and populate. He was to raise children who would live according to God's instructions and care for and improve the earth.

Quran and the hadith do not clarify the number of children of Adam and Hawwah.
History books mention that they had 40 children. Ibn Al-Jawzi said that Hawwah gave birth to 20 twins, each time a boy and a girl.

According to the Quran and Bible, lifespan of some prophets was much longer than of modern people. They lived for up to one thousand years. According to Genesis, Adam died when he was 930.

Quran says that the first place of worship was built in the current location of Kaaba. There is no information in the Quran or authentic hadith on who built the first House of God. Some commentators of the Quran say that it was built by angels, some that Adam was directed by skies to travel until he arrived at the deserts of Hijaz and he was guided to build a santuary there.

    "The first sanctuary ever constructed for mankind was that at Bakkah (the old title of Makkah), a fortunate location and advice for the worlds".
    Quran

## Habyl and Qabyl -- Abel and Cain: First Murder

</summary>

Habyl and Qabyl (Abel and Cain). Cain tilted the land while Abel raised cattle. 

Both the brothers were asked to offer up individual sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's sacrifice because of Abel's righteousness and Cain, out of jealousy, threw a rock at Abel, leading to the first murder in human history: the murder of Abel by Cain. 27th verse of chapter 5 (sūrat al-Māidah). 

Shaytan taught him how to kill. Cain regretted that he killed his brother and became of the regretful.

Cain did not know what to do with his brother's corpse. Allah sent two ravens that began fighting, causing the death of one. The victorious bird used its beak and claws to dig a hole in the ground, wolled the victim bird into it and covered it with sand.

    Then Allah sent a crow searching in the ground to show him how to hide the disgrace of his brother. He said: "O woe to me! Have I failed to be like this crow and hide the body of my brother? And he became of the regretful."
    Quran (5:31)

This was the first murder and burial on earth by a man.

## Sheeth -- Seth

</summary>

Although the Quran makes no mention of Sheeth ibn Adam, he is revered within Islamic tradition as the third and righteous son of Adam and Eve and seen as the gift bestowed on Adam after the death of Abel.

Medieval historian and exegete al-Tabari and other scholars say that Seth buried Adam.

The Islamic literature holds that Seth was born when Adam was past 100 and that Adam appointed Seth as guide to his people. The 11th-century Syrian historian and translator Al-Mubashshir ibn Fātik recorded the maxims and aphorisms of the ancient philosophers in his book Kitāb mukhtār al-ḥikam wa-maḥāsin al-kalim and included a chapter on Seth. Within Islamic tradition Seth holds wisdom of several kinds; knowledge of time, prophecy of the future Great Flood, and inspiration on the methods of night prayer. Islam, Judaism and Christianity trace the genealogy of mankind back to Seth since Abel left no heirs and Cain's heirs, according to tradition, were destroyed by the Great Flood. Many traditional Islamic crafts are traced back to Seth, such as the making of horn combs.

At that time, 🎷 flute, music and dancing was invented. According to the Bible, Jubal the descendant of Cain invenved flute and music.

According to Genesis 4:25, Seth was born after Abel's murder by Cain, and Eve believed that God had appointed him as a replacement for Abel. According to Genesis, Seth died at the age of 912 (that is, 14 years before Noah's birth).

## Idris -- Enoch

</summary>

Idris was born when Adam pbuh was alive. Idris is mentioned in the Quran that he was of high class and a prophet. According to some narrations, Idris was the first to write.

Idris is mentioned twice in the Quran, where he is described as a wise man. In surah 19 of the Quran, God says:

    "Also mention in the Book the case of Idris: He was a man of truth (and sincerity), (and) a prophet:
    And We raised him to a exalted place."
    Quran 19:56–57
    
    "And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Dhu al-Kifl, all (men) of constancy and patience;
    We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones."
    Quran 21:85–86 (Yusuf Ali)

According to later Muslim writings, Idris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, God bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were not yet Muslims. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of the people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of his people left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.

They asked Prophet Idris: "If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?" Prophet Idris said: "If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us." So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: "SubhanAllah."

Islamic literature narrates that Idris was made prophet at around 40, which parallels the age when Muhammad began to prophesy, and lived during a time when people had begun to worship fire. Exegesis embellishes upon the lifetime of Idris, and states that the prophet divided his time into two. For three days of the week, Idris would preach to his people and four days he would devote solely to the worship of God. Many early commentators, such as Tabari, credited Idris with possessing great wisdom and knowledge.

Exegesis narrates that Idris was among "the first men to use the pen as well as being one of the first men to observe the movement of the stars and set out scientific weights and measures." These attributes remain consistent with the identification of Enoch with Idris, as these attributes make it clear that Idris would have most probably lived during the Generations of Adam, the same era during which Enoch lived. Ibn Arabi described Idris as the "prophet of the philosophers" and a number of works were attributed to him. Some scholars wrote commentaries on these supposed works, all while Idris was also credited with several inventions, including the art of making garments.

The commentator Ibn Ishaq narrated that he was the first man to write with a pen and that he was born when Adam still had 308 years of his life to live. In his commentary on the Quranic verses 19:56-57, the commentator Ibn Kathir narrated "During the Night Journey, the Prophet passed by him in fourth heaven. In a hadith, Ibn Abbas asked Ka’b what was meant by the part of the verse which says, ”And We raised him to a high station.” Ka’b explained: Allah revealed to Idris: ‘I would raise for you every day the same amount of the deeds of all Adam’s children’ – perhaps meaning of his time only. So Idris wanted to increase his deeds and devotion. 

A friend of his from the angels visited and Idris said to him: ‘Allah has revealed to me such and such, so could you please speak to the angel of death, so I could increase my deeds.’ The angel carried him on his wings and went up into the heavens. When they reached the fourth heaven, they met the angel of death who was descending down towards earth. The angel spoke to him about what Idris had spoken to him before. The angel of death said: ‘But where is Idris?’ He replied, ‘He is upon my back.’ The angel of death said: ‘How astonishing! I was sent and told to seize his soul in the fourth heaven. I kept thinking how I could seize it in the fourth heaven when he was on the earth?’ Then he took his soul out of his body, and that is what is meant by the verse: ‘And We raised him to a high station.’

Early accounts of Idris' life attributed "thirty portions of revealed scripture" to him. Therefore, Idris was understood by many early commentators to be both a prophet as well as a messenger. Several modern commentators have linked this sentiment with Biblical apocrypha such as the Book of Enoch and the Second Book of Enoch.

After Idris, his son and successor Mehthusaleh continued in Allah's path, calling His servants to Him.

In the Bible, Enoch receives visions of how the Earth will be destroyed in the End of Times and how people who did good will receive their reward and how people who did bad deeds will receive their punishment.

## How Idol Worshipping Appeared

</summary>

There was a time of righteous people. Pople lived in tawhid and five of them were most righteous and most popular: Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, Nasr. So people started celebrating anniversaries of these men. They made statues of these noble men to remind people of their piety and nobility, but some generations later, some people started worshiping these statues.

    And they have said: "You shall not leave your gods: nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwa', nor Yaghuth, nor Ya'uq nor Nasr"(these were the names of their idols).
    Quran 71:23

Ibn Abbas said in his commentary of the above ayah: "These were idols of Prophet Nuh's nation which in time ended up among the Arabs... These idols were named after some righteous men among Nuh's people..." [Sahih Al-Bukhari]

Long before the arrival of Prophet Nuh (pbuh) people used to practice Tawheed. They worshipeed none but Allah as taught by Prophet Adam (pbuh). Among them were some righteous men, who were well-known for their piety and devotion. When these righteous men died, shaitaan came to the people and inspired them to make statues of them. bearing their names. The intention was to remember their devotion to Allah and to encourage people to be more like them.

People agreed to this seemingly noble idea. They placed the statues where those righteous people used to frequently meet. But they did not worship them.

However, years later, after that generation died, people slowly forgot the purpose of those statues. Shaitaan now came to their descendants and told them that their predecessors used to worship these statues for rain and other blessings. Due to a lack of knowledge, they were fooled by Shaitaan into worshiping the idols, which then their descendants followed as well.

Thus, Shaitaan introduced idol worship among the people of Nuh, peace be upon him. So strong was their belief in the idols that later when Prophet Nuh, peace be upon him, asked them to worship Allah alone, they would not listen.

    "They put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments, persisted, and were arrogant with [great] arrogance."
    Quran 71:7

### How Shaitan Plans his Tricks

Consider how Shaitan did not simply suggest to the people to worship idols. He gradually and patiently poisoned their minds. A couple of generations later, Shirk seemed normal and even ‘sensible’ to them.

Shaitan has been using this trick for ages and continues to do so today. One has to only see the fitnah among people nowadays and compare it with a few decades ago.

# 3. Nuh (Noah) and Great Flood ⛴🕊⛰
*************************************

<details><summary>

## Story of Nuh Shortly

</summary>

> **Nuh**ﷺ    is the second most narrated prophet in the Quran. he was the first prophet who was sent to people who were committing shirk. 
> 950 years he has been giving da'wah to his people, only about 10 to 80 people believed him. And after all these years he lost hope and made dua to Allah not to leave disbelievers on earth.
> Allah told Nuh to build a huge arc, take onboard the believers and pairs of animals. Then the great flood began, water was coming both from rains and from the ground. All disbelievers drowned. Only believers on the Arc survived.
> After the Flood, Nuh with the believers started life on earth anew.
> Many ancient civilizations have stories of the Great Flood. There are many different variations but the main theme is the same: God sent the Flood to punish evil-doers, and those who were left alive started the human life on earth once again.

## Nuh preaches to his people

</summary>

The Quran tells the story of Noah, the flood story and his people in many places. As a summary of the flood story, it appears in surah
number 7 (Surah Al-A'raf) for the first time, and for the last time, in Surah number 71 (Surah Nuh). Mainly, three Surahs details the story, namely Surah Nuḥ, Surah Hud, and Surah al-Mu’minun.

According to Islam, Nuh was a prophet, sent to warn mankind of that region and his people to change their ways. He conveyed the message for over 950 years. Islamic literature recounts that in the Generations of Adam, many men and women continued to follow Adam's original teachings, worshiping God alone and remaining righteous. Among Adam's descendants there were many brave and pious men, greatly loved and revered by their respective communities. Exegesis goes on to narrate that, upon the death of these elders, people felt enormous grief and some felt prompted to make statues of these people in remembrance of them. Then gradually, through the generations many forgot what such statues were for and began to worship them, (as the Shaytan (Satan) slowly deceived each generation) along with many other idols. In order to guide the people, God appointed Noah with the duty of being the next prophet to humanity.

### Early preaching of Noah

According to Islamic belief, Noah began preaching to his people both verbally and by example. He would praise God consistently and he urged his people to do the same, warning his tribe of the punishment they would face if they did not mend their ignorant ways. The Qur'an states that Noah repeatedly told his people:

    "O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day!"

Early on, a few were moved by Noah's words but the powerful and wealthy members of the tribe refused to hear his call. The unbelievers at the time were impelled to rebel by various evil motives. Firstly, they were extremely envious and jealous of men superior to them in any way. Secondly, the people were ignorant of the weak and lowly, who were frequently superior intellectually, morally and spiritually. 

As a result of their ignorance, they were arrogant and mocked all who they felt were inferior to them. Saying "Are we to believe you, when those who follow you are the most abject of people?" Noah responded: "Their judgment rests only with my Lord, if you could perceive." When Noah preached the faith of God to them, all they did was revile the messenger, abuse the message and call the whole warning a lie. He then went on to explain the Message in greater depth, ensuring them that it was not a message of destruction but it was a message with the mercy from God, and that their acts would lead to destruction if they did not accept the faith. He questioned them, asking why they would not accept what would benefit them in the near future. Noah went onto further, and told his community that he asked of no reward from them, telling them his only reward would be from God. But his people threatened him with being stoned.

### Accusation

As time passed, Noah became firmer in his preaching. When the unbelievers began insulting those who accepted God's message, believing that Noah would send those faithful away to attract the wealthy unbelievers, Noah revealed that they — the arrogant and ignorant rich — were the wicked and sinful ones. His people accused him of being soothsayer or diviner. Noah declared that he was by no means a mere fortune-teller, pretending to reveal secrets which are not worth revealing. Noah also denied accusations claiming he was an angel, always maintaining that he was a human messenger. When the people refused to acknowledge their sinfulness Noah told them that it was not Noah, but God that would punish them — however God pleased.

### Nuh prays to God against disbelievers

The Quran states that Noah prayed to God, telling him that his preaching only made his people disbelieve further. Noah told God how they had closed their minds to accepting the message, so that the light of the truth should not affect their thinking. Noah told God how he had used all the resources of the classical preacher, conveying the message both in public places and with individuals in private. Noah spoke of how he had told the people the rewards they would receive if they became righteous, namely that God would supply plentiful rain as a blessing, and that God would also guarantee them an increase in children and wealth.

    He said, "My Lord! Verily, I have called my people day and night. But my calls only made them run farther away. And verily, every time i called unto them than You might forgive them, they thrust their fingers into their ears, covered themselves with garments, and persisted (in their refusal), and magnified themselves in pride. Then verily, I called to them openly (aloud). Then verily, I proclaimed to them in public, and I have appealed to them in private."
    Quran, Surah Nuh (71:5-9)

And Noah prayed to God not to leave disbelievers on earth. 

    Noah had prayed, "My Lord! Do not leave a single disbeliever on earth.
    For if You spare ˹any of˺ them, they will certainly mislead Your servants, and give birth only to ˹wicked˺ sinners, staunch disbelievers.
    My Lord! Forgive me, my parents, and whoever enters my house in faith, and ˹all˺ believing men and women. And increase the wrongdoers only in destruction."
    Quran, Surah Nuh (71:26-28)

## Nuh builds the Ark

</summary>

According to the Quran, one day, Noah received a revelation from God, in which he was told that no one would believe the message now aside from those who have already submitted to God. Noah's frustration at the defiance of his people led him to ask God to not leave even one sinner upon earth. 

Although there is no proof that God accepted his prayer (as there are many examples of accepted prayers, such as in case of Yunus, Lut (Lot), Suleyman (Solomon) etc., even Noah's prayer in some other shape was accepted), God decreed that a terrible flood would come (and yet, Qur'an doesn't say it came to cover the whole Earth) and He ordered Noah to build a ship (Fulk) which would save him and the believers from this dreadful calamity. 

Ever obedient to God's instructions, Noah went out in search of material with which to build the vessel. When Noah began building the Ark, the people who saw him at work laughed at him even more than before. Their conclusion was that he was surely a madman – they could not find any other reason why a man would build a huge vessel when no sea or river was nearby. Although Noah was now very old, the continued to work tirelessly until, at last, the Ship was finished.

### Noah's Family

Little is known of Noah's personal history before his call to prophecy. However, Ibn Kathir records him to have been the son of Lamech and grandson of Methuselah, one of the patriarchs from the Generations of Adam. Noah was neither the leader of the tribe nor a very rich man but, even before being called to prophecy, he worshiped God faithfully and was, in the words of the Qur'an, "a devotee most grateful".

Noah was married to a woman whose name is not mentioned in the Quran. Islamic scholars agree that Noah had four sons whose names were Ham, Shem, Yam and Japheth. According to the Quran, one of Noah's sons was a disbeliever who refused to come aboard the Ark, instead preferring to climb a mountain, where he drowned. It is agreed among most Islamic scholars that Yam was the one who drowned; the other three remained believers.

The Quran states that Noah's wife was not a believer with him so she did not join him; neither did one of Noah's sons (Yam), who was secretly a disbeliever but had pretended faith in front of Noah. The sons of Noah are not expressly mentioned in the Qur'an, except for the fact that one of the sons was among the people who did not follow his own father, not among the believers and thus was washed away in the flood. Also the Qur'an indicates a great calamity, enough to have destroyed Noah's people, but to have saved him and his generations to come. Noah's wife is referred to in the Qur'an as an evil woman. When God emphasizes upon the notion that everyone is for themselves on the Day of Judgement and that marital relations will not be to your aid when the judgement takes place.

In contrast, the wife of the Pharaoh of the Exodus, Asiya, and Mary, the mother of Jesus, are referred to as among the best of women. This adds to the notion that, on the Last Day, everyone will be judged according to their own deeds. The "Stories of The Prophets" explain that the son who declined to embark was a non-believer.

## The Great Flood

</summary>

At the day of the flood, Noah saw the sign of the boiling oven as God had said to him. God ordered Noah to load his ark with believers and representative animals in pairs. 

    [So it was], until when God’s command came and the oven overflowed, God said, "Load upon the ship of each [creature] two mates and your family, except those about whom the word has preceded, and [include] whoever has believed." But none had believed with him, except a few.
    Quran

As a result of being one of the disbelievers, his son denied coming with him, and he chose to go up on the mountain instead. The son of Noah drowned in the flood water. Noah cried to God to save his son, but God denied to accept his prayer and let him (Noah’s son) be drowned. Noah begged pardon for asking help to save his son from God.

Another disbeliever in Noah’s family was his wife herself. She did not join Noah in the Ark. And as a result, she was also drowned in the flood water. The number of believers was not clearly specified in the Qur’an. According to Ibn Abbas, that there were 80 believers and the historian Ka’ab Al Akbar proclaimed that the number of believers was 72 and other source stated that the number of believers was 10 in the Ark of Noah.

Noah entered into the ark while the flood water began to come forth heavily. Before entering the Ark, Noah prayed to God to forgive him and his ancestors for saying the following prayers:

    "My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my dwelling (boat) as a believer (believing men and believing women).”

On the other hand, he also prayed to ruin the disbelievers by saying:

    "And do not increase the wrongdoers except putting in destruction.”

God also opened the gate of heaven (water gate) to be mixed with the water of the earth. Flood water submerged everything on the face of the earth. Such heavy rainfall had never been seen before. The rainfall and the sea water and waves washed away all living beings except Noah and those believers who were with him in the Ark. The Qur’an describes the flood"

    And then, [Allah] opened the gates of the heavens with rain pouring down.

In this verse, the Arabic word ر مِهَنْم , ُّderived from root (ر م ه ,(means pouring down). That means rain water came so vigorously from the sky like someone was pouring it down.

    And God caused springs to stream from the earth. Therefore, the waters from the earth and the heaven joined for a matter of predetermined (programmed long before).

Here in this verse, the Arabic word ر َدِ
ُق  is a verb, derived from root ر د ق , and the meaning is predestined. That indicates the magnitude of the flood was planned beforehand to make sure the definitive destruction of the nation. God also pre-planned how He would save the believers under His surveillance. According to the Qur’an, God says:

    "And I carried him on a construction (boat) made of planks and nails, the carrier on which Noah (as) and his followers embarked Floated under my Eyes (surveillance). It was a Reward for him who had been denied of the suffering."

The dry land was covered by the flood water and all the disbelievers drowned in the water. The earth was flooded showing a clear sign of punishment for disbelieving in one and only God. But Noah was safely floating on the flood water only by the mercy of Allah. None but Allah helped him to survive.

    "Indeed, when the water overflowed, I (Allah) carried you (Noah) in the sailing (ark).”

### After The Flood

After the flood, humankind started over and for some time they lived in tawhid.

    And it was said: "O earth! Swallow up your water, and O sky! Withhold (your rain)." And the water was diminished (made to subside) and the Decree (of Allah) was fulfilled (i.e. the destruction of the people of Noah). And it (the ship) rested on Mount Judi, and it was said: "Away with the people who are Zalimeen (polytheists and wrong-doing)!" 
    Quran Ayah 11:44
    
    It was said: "O Noah! Come down (from the ship) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on the people who are with you (and on some of their offspring), but (there will be other) people to whom We shall grant their pleasures (for a time), but in the end a painful torment will reach them from Us." 
    Quran, Surah 11:48

With the issue of the divine command, calm returned to earth, the water retreated, and the dry land shone once again in the rays of the sun. The flood had cleansed the earth of the disbelievers and polytheists.

Noah released the birds and the beasts, which scattered over the earth. After that the believers disembarked. Noah put his forehead to the ground in prostration. The survivors kindled a fire and sat around it. Lighting a fire had been prohibited on board so as not to ignite the ship's wood and burn it up. None of them had eaten hot food during the entire period of the flood. Following the disembarkation there was a day of fasting in thanks to Allah.

The Quran draws the curtain on Noah's story. We do not know how his affairs with his people continued. All we know or can ascertain is that on his deathbed, Noah requested his son to worship Allah alone. Noah then passed away.

Abdullah Ibn Amru Ibn Alaas narrated that Prophet Muhammad said: "When the death of the Messenger of Allah Noah approached, he admonished his sons: 'Indeed I would give you far-reaching advice, commanding you to do two things, and warning you against doing two as well. I charge you (to believe) that there is no god but Allah and that if the seven heavens and the seven earths were put on one side of a scale and the words 'There is no god but Allah' were put on the other, the latter would outweigh the former. And I warn you against associating partners with Allah and against pride.'"

## Ancient Stories about The Flood

</summary>

Mention of the great flood occurs in stories of many old nations:
the Mesopotamian flood stories, the Genesis flood narrative, Nuh (Noah) in Islam, manvantara-sandhya in Hinduism, the Gun-Yu in Chinese mythology, Deucalion and Pyrrha in Greek mythology, Bergelmir in Norse mythology, the arrival of the first inhabitants of Ireland with Cessair in Irish mythology, in parts of Polynesia such as Hawaii, the lore of the K'iche' and Maya peoples in Mesoamerica, the Lac Courte Oreilles Ojibwa tribe of Native Americans in North America, the Muisca and Cañari Confederation in South America, Africa, and some Aboriginal tribes in Australia.

One example of a flood story is the Epic of Gilgamesh. Many scholars believe that this account was copied from the Akkadian Atra-Hasis, which dates to the 18th century BC. In the Gilgamesh flood myth, the highest god, Enlil, decides to destroy the world with a flood because humans have become too noisy. The god Ea, who had created humans out of clay and divine blood, secretly warns the hero Utnapishtim of the impending flood and gives him detailed instructions for building a boat so that life may survive. Both the Epic of Gilgamesh and Atra-Hasis are preceded by the similar Sumerian creation myth (c. 1600 BC)—the oldest surviving example of such a flood-story narrative, known from tablets found in the ruins of Nippur.

## Hud and People of 'Ad

</summary>

'Ad was an ancient tribe in Arabian Peninsula. People of Aad were tall, strong and famous for their craftsmanshift, especially in building construction. 

In Islamic tradition, the Adites are believed to be among the first inhabitants of Arabia. They belong to what is known as the Extinct Arabs (العرب البائدة).

After ʽAd's death, his sons Shadid and Shedad reigned in succession over the Adites. ʿĀd then became a collective term for all those descended from ʽAd.

According to the Quran, Iram (إرم) is the place to which the prophet Hud (هود) was sent in order to guide its people back to the righteous path of God. The citizens continued in their polytheistic ways and Allah destroyed[1] their city in a great storm.

Quran 89:6-14 mentions ʿĀd:

    Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with ʽAad - [With] Iram – who had lofty pillars, the likes of whom had never been created in the lands. And [with] Thamud, who carved out the rocks in the valley? And [with] Pharaoh, owner of the stakes? [All of] whom oppressed within the lands and increased therein the corruption. So your Lord poured upon them a scourge of punishment. Indeed, your Lord is in observation.
    Quran 89:6–14 

At first, Ad people worshipped only Allah but then they made idols from stones. and Allah sent them their brother Hud. and they called their prophet a fool and a liar and said Hud to tell Allah to send his punishment if you are truthfull. Then a draught happened. Plants died but people continued to worship idols. The draught lasted 3 years. Allah told Hud to gather his followers and leave.

And then a black cloud approached them. People of Aad thought that this cloud will bring them rain. The weather changed. The wind ripped their houses apart and destroyed their buildings. The storm did not stop until the entire region was reduced to ruins.

    We sent to the people of 'Ad their brother Hud, who said: "O my people, worship God; you have no other god but He. (As for the idols,) you are only inventing lies.
    
    O my people, I ask no recompense of you for it: My reward is with Him who created me. Will you not, therefore, understand?
    O my people, beg your Lord to forgive you, and turn to Him in repentance. He will send down rain in torrents for you from the skies, and give you added strength. So do not turn away from Him as sinners."
    
    They said: "O Hud, you have come to us with no proofs. We shall not abandon our gods because you say so, nor believe in you.
    All we can say is that some of our gods have smitten you with evil." He replied:" I call God to witness, and you be witness too, that I am clear of what you associate (in your affairs)
    
    Apart from Him. Contrive against me as much as you like, and give me no respite.
    I place my trust in God who is my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature that moves on the earth who is not held by the forelock firmly by Him. Verily the way of my Lord is straight.
    
    If you turn away, then (remember) I have delivered to you the message I was sent with. My Lord will put other people in your place, and you will not be able to prevail against Him. Indeed my Lord keeps a watch over all things."
    Qur'an, sura 11 (Hud), ayah 50-57

After Hud has been left alone by the people of ʿĀd for a long time. The majority of them, however, refused to pay any notice to his teachings and they kept ignoring and mocking all he said. As their aggression, arrogance and idolatry deepened, God, after plenty of warning, sent a thunderous storm to finish the wicked people of ʿĀd once and for all. The destruction of the ʿĀd is described in the Quran:

    So when they saw it as a cloud advancing towards their valleys, they said: "This is just a passing cloud that will bring us rain." "No. It is what you were trying to hasten: The wind which carries the grievous punishment!
    It will destroy everything at the bidding of its Lord." So in the morning there was nothing but their empty dwellings to be seen. That is how We requite the sinners.
    Qur'an, Surah 46 (Al-Ahqaf), ayah 24-25

The King Saud University from The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia stated the interpretation from Al-Tabari of Quran 69:6–129 were narrated about the disaster which caused the extinction of ʿĀd. Wahbah al-Zuhayli, Salih bin Abdullah al Humaid, Imam of Grand Mosque of Mecca, along with the officials of Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Dawah and Guidance also agreed the verse were speaking about the punishment from God towards ʿĀd peoples.

Meanwhile, another Quran verse that describe further the characteristic of winds that bear calamity were Adh-Dhariyat:

    And in ‘Ad when We unleashed upon them a barren wind.
    Qur'an Surah 51,(Adh-Dhariyat), ayah 41

Exegesis experts translate the "al-Rih ul-Aqeem" (الريح العقيم) literally as "fruitless wind" or "barren wind", a winds that does not bring benefit or any positive reaction to any biological existences. According to Arabic linguists and tafseer experts has examined the al Aqeem are in it literal form as "sterile" in this verse context, which correlate the antithesis of common characteristic of natural winds that usually benefitted the natural cycle or any biological progressions or reproductions whether for humans, animals, or plants.

In addition for its barren characteristic, another verse also described additional feature about the catastrophic tornado which decimated the 'Ad were Al-Qamar:

    Surely We sent on them an evil omen (catastrophes), the wind (a furious very cold of harsh voice) that lasts throughout the day.
    Qur'an Surah 54,(al-Qamar), ayah 19

Hud has been sometimes identified with Eber, but according to the Bible Selah is the father of Eber which would go againt the Quranic narration that people of 'Ad were predecessors of Thamud.

## Saleh and people of Thamud 🐪

</summary>

> There are some contradictory opinions regarding the time of the Thamud. There are mentions that Thamud were a tribal confederation in the northwestern region of the Arabian Peninsula, mentioned in Assyrian sources in the time of Sargon II (8th century BC). The tribe's name continues to appear in documents into the fourth century CE, but by the sixth century they were regarded as a group that had **vanished long ago**. It is possible that the Thamud were not one tribe, and that other tribes took on the name of Thamūd after the original tribe by that name had gone extinct.

According to the Quran, the city that Saleh was sent to was called al-Hijr, which corresponds to the Nabataean city of Hegra. The city rose to prominence around the first century AD as an important site in the regional caravan trade. Adjacent to the city were large, decorated rock-cut tombs used by members of various religious groups.

Saleh's life in his community had been so righteous that the people of Thamud virtually relied upon him for support. He was chosen by God as a Messenger and sent to preach against the selfishness of the wealthy and to condemn the practice of Shirk (Idolatry or Polytheism). Although Saleh preached the message for a sustained period of time, the people of Thamud refused to hear his warning and instead began to ask Saleh to perform a miracle for them.

    To the Thamūd, We sent their brother, Ṣāliḥ. He said, "My people, worship God. You have no god other than Him. It was He who brought you into being from the earth and made you inhabit it, so ask forgiveness from Him, and turn back to Him: my Lord is near, and ready to answer." 

    They said, "Ṣāliḥ, We used to have such great hope in you. Will you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshiped? We are in grave doubt about what you are asking us to do." 

    He said, "My people, just think: if I did have clear proof from my Lord, and if He had given me mercy of His own, who could protect me from God if I disobeyed Him? You would only make my loss greater. 
    Quran, surah 11

Saleh reminded his people of the countless castles and palaces they built out of stone, and of their technological superiority over neighboring communities. Furthermore, he told them about their ancestors, the ʿĀd tribe, and how they too were destroyed for their sins. Some of the people of Thamud believed Saleh's words, but the tribal leaders refused to listen to him and continued to demand that he demonstrate a miracle to prove his prophethood.

In response, God gave the Thamud a blessed she-camel, as both a means of sustenance and a test. The tribe was told to allow the camel to graze peacefully and avoid harming her. But in defiance of Saleh's warning, the people of the tribe hamstrung the camel. Saleh informed them that they had only three more days to live before the wrath of God descended upon them. The people of the city were remorseful, but their crime could not be undone, and all the disbelieving people in the city were killed in an earthquake. Al-Hijr was rendered uninhabited and remained in ruins for all time thereafter. Saleh himself and the few believers who followed him survived.

My people, this camel belongs to God, a sign for you, so leave it to pasture on God's earth and do not harm it, or you will soon be punished." 

    But they hamstrung it, so he said, "Enjoy life for another three days: this warning will not prove false." 

    And so, when Our command was fulfilled, by Our mercy We saved Ṣāliḥ and his fellow believers from the disgrace of that day. [Prophet], it is your Lord who is the Strong, the Mighty One. The blast struck the evildoers and they lay dead in their homes, as though they had never lived and flourished there. 

    Yes, the Thamūd denied their Lord—so away with the Thamūd!
    Quran 11:61–68

The story is expanded upon in Sūrat an-Naml, whilst the she-camel is not mentioned explicitly here, it states that nine men plotted to kill Salih and his whole family, a crime for which they were struck down by God 3 days later.

Salih is mostly associated with biblical Selah (Hebrew: שֶׁלַח, romanized: Šélaḥ), Salah or Sala (Greek: Σαλά – Salá) or Shelah is an ancestor of the Ishmaelites and Israelites according to the Table of Nations in Genesis 10. He is thus one of the table's “seventy names.” He is also mentioned in Genesis 11:12–15, 1 Chronicles 1:18–24, and Luke 3:35-36. In the ancestral line from Noah to Abraham, he is the son of Arpachshad (in the Masoretic Text and Samaritan Pentateuch) or Cainan (in the Septuagint ) and the father of Eber.

# 4. Ibrahim (Abraham)
*******************************************

> ~ 2nd millenium BCE (2100-1900, according to Biblical scholars)

<details><summary>

## Timeline Side-Note

</summary>

Ibrahim was born in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees in the Ancient Mesopotamia (present-day Iraq). The ziggurat of Ur stand in the desert till this day. Ibrahim traditionally believed to have lived some time in the 2nd millennium BC.

In Jewish and Islamic traditions a confrontation between Nimrod and Abraham is said to have taken place. 

Archaeologist and biblical scholar William F. Albright maintained (c. 1961) that the narratives of Abraham and Jacob could be dated to about the 19th century BCE.

There is no agreed opinion on how many generations passed from Adam till Nuh, from Nuh till Ibrahim. The Jewish sources claim that the humanity lived only 6000 years but Muslims don't have this fixed timeline, we can extrapolate. There is scientific evidence that Homo-Sapiens existed for several hundred thousand years, and there is no contradiction to the Quran because there is no certain timeline given in The Book. Also, the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    said that the distance between me and Al Kiyamah is like distance between my two fingers.

The best answer to this issue is Allahu 'Alim, God knows best.

## Ibrahim: Searching for Truth

</summary>

>**Ibrahim** plays an important role in Islam. Islam regards Abraham as a link in the chain of prophets that begins with Adam and culminates in Muhammad. Ibrāhīm is mentioned in 35 chapters of the Quran, more often than any other prophet apart from Moses. He is called both a hanif (monotheist) and muslim (one who submits), and Muslims regard him as a prophet and patriarch, the archetype of the perfect Muslim, and the revered reformer of the Kaaba in Mecca. Islamic traditions consider Ibrāhīm the first Pioneer of Islam (which is also called millat Ibrahim, the "religion of Abraham"), and that his purpose and mission throughout his life was to proclaim the Oneness of God. In Islam, Abraham holds an exalted position among the major prophets and he is referred to as "Ibrahim Khalilullah", meaning `Abraham the Beloved of God` or `Friend of God`.
>
> Besides Ishaq and Yaqub, Ibrahim is among the most honorable and the most excellent men in sight of God. Ibrahim was also mentioned in Quran as "Father of Muslims" and the role model for the community.
>
> Hajj was established by Ibrahim. Kurban sacrifice was established by the example of Ibrahim and his son. The main mosque of Muslims the Kaaba was built by Ibrahim and his son. The Zamzam well was discovered to console Ibrahim's wife Hajar and their son Ismail. Ibrahim had two sons Iskhak and Ishmael. Iskhak became the father of Jewish people. Ismail helped Ibrahim to build the Kaaba and became the father of Arab people. And Ibrahim made a dua to have a righteous descendand and a prophet from Ismail, to which Allah answered by sending the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  .
> 
> Ibrahim is from Iraq, Hajar is from Egypt.
> Accroding to Bible, Ishmael and Isaac buried Ibrahim together.

Ibrahim was born in a house of idolaters in the ancient city of Ur of the Chaldees, likely the place called 'Ur' in present-day Iraq, in which case, the idolaters would have been practitioners of the hypothesized Ancient Mesopotamian religion.

His father Azar was a well-known idol-sculptor that his people worshiped. As a young child, Ibrahim used to watch his father sculpting these idols from stones or wood. When his father was finished with them, Ibrahim would ask his father why they could not move or respond to any request and then would mock them; therefore, his father would always scold him for not following his ancestors' rituals and mocking their idols.

When Ibrahim was young, he used to laugh whenever he saw them entering the temple, lowering their heads, silently offering the statues the best of their food, crying and asking forgiveness from them. He started feeling angry towards his people, who could not realize that these are only stones that could neither benefit nor harm them.

    And [mention, O Muhammad], when Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols as deities? Indeed, I see you and your people to be in manifest error."
    And thus did We show Abraham the realm of the heavens and the earth that he would be among the certain [in faith].
    Quran, Surah Al-An'am Ayah 74-75

### Searching for Truth

One night, Abraham went up to the mountain, leaned against a rock, and looked up to the sky.

    So when the night covered him [with darkness], he saw a star. He said, "This is my lord." But when it set, he said, "I like not those that disappear."

But when it set he said: "I don't like those that set." The star had disappeared so it could not be God. God is always present. Then he saw the moon rising in splendor.

    And when he saw the moon 🌙 rising, he said, "This is my lord." But when it set, he said, "Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the people gone astray."
          
    And when he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my lord; this is greater." But when it set, he said, "O my people, indeed I am free from what you associate with Allah.
          
    Indeed, I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not of those who associate others with Allah."
    6-Surah Al-An’am ( The Cattle ) 74-79

After this declaration, Abraham heard Allah calling him, "O Abraham" Abraham trembled and said, "Here I am O my Lord!" Allah replied, "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" Abraham fell to the ground, crying. He said: "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" Abraham kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.

## Destroying Idols

</summary>

Being a wise son, Ibrahim did not make his father feel foolish; nor did he openly laugh at his conduct. He told him that he loved him, thereby hoping to generate fatherly love.

Then he gently asked him:

    "Behold, he said to his father: "O my father! why worship that which heareth not and seeth not, and can profit thee nothing?"
    Surah Maryam 19:42

And before his father could become angry, he hastily said:

    O my father! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee: so follow me: I will guide thee to a way that is even and straight. O my father! serve not Satan: for Satan is a rebel against (Allah) Most Gracious. O my father! I fear lest a Penalty afflict thee from (Allah) Most Gracious, so that thou become to Satan a friend.
    Surah Maryam 19:43-45

In the same way, he again used reasoning with the idol-worshipers and said:

    "Behold, he said to his father and his people: "What worship ye?" They said: "We worship idols, and we remain constantly in attendance on them." He said: "Do they listen to you when ye call (on them), or do you good or harm?" They said: "Nay, but we found our fathers doing thus (what we do)." He said: "Do ye then see whom ye have been worshipping" 
    Surah Al Shu'ara' 26:71-75

However, they (the idolaters) did not give up but clung fast to idolatry, then he (AS) said:

    "And by God, I have a plan for your idols - after ye go away and turn your backs."
    Surah Al Anbiya 21:57

It was time for a religious festival, perhaps dedicated to Sin, for which they left the town. Abraham was invited to attend the festivities, but he excused himself, and then he destroyed all idols in the temple and left only the biggest one. after people came back and accused Ibrahim of destroying idols, he said that that biggest one did it. 

    "Then did he turn to their aliha (gods) and said, "will ye not eat (of the offerings before you)? "What is the matter with you that ye speak not (intelligently)?" Then did he turn upon them, striking (them) with the right hand." 
    Surah Al Saffat 37:91-93

    "So he broke them to pieces, (all) but the biggest of them, that they might turn (and address themselves) to it." 
    Surah Al Anbiya 21:58

He enacted this scene, to make the people ashamed of worshiping powerless and senseless stocks and stones. He broke all the idols except the biggest, so as to show that a fight had taken place between the idols, and the biggest idol had smashed the others. So, when they came back:

    They said, "Who has done this to our aliha (gods)? He must indeed be some man of impiety!" They said, "We heard a youth talk of them: He is called Ibrahim." They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness." 

    They said, "Art thou the one that did this with our gods, O Ibrahim?" He said: "Nay, this was done by - this is their biggest one! ask them, if they can speak intelligently!"

    So they turned to themselves and said, "Surely ye are the ones in the wrong!" Then were they confounded with shame: (they said), "Thou knowest full well that these (idols) do not speak!" 

    (Ibrahim) said, "Do ye then worship, besides Allah, things that can neither be of any good to you nor do you harm? "Fie upon you, and upon the things that ye worship besides Allah! Have ye no sense?" 

    They said, "Burn him and protect your gods, If ye do (anything at all)!" We said, "O Fire! be thou cool, and (a means of) safety for Ibrahim!" Then they sought a stratagem against him: but We made them the ones that lost most!" 
    Surah Al Anbiya 21:59-70

Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.) was able to subdue them with logical arguments. However, their arrogance would not allow them to admit their foolishness. All they could do was to use their power of authority, as tyrants usually do, to punish Ibrahim (A.S.). They kept him in chains and planned their revenge.

The decision to have Abraham burned at the stake was affirmed by the temple priests and the king of Babylon, Nimrod. The news spread like fire in the kingdom and people were coming from all places to watch the execution. A huge pit was dug up and a large quantity of wood was piled up. Then the biggest fire people ever witnessed was lit. The flames were so high up in the sky that even the birds could not fly over it for fear of being burnt themselves. Ibrahim's hands and feet were chained, and he was put in a catapult, ready to be thrown in. 

During this time, Angel Jibril came to him and said: "O Ibrahim! Is there anything you wish for?" Ibrahim could have asked to be saved from the fire or to be taken away, but Ibrahim replied, "God is sufficient for me, He is the best disposer of my affairs." 

The catapult was released and Ibrahim was thrown into the fire. God then gave an order to the fire:

    "O fire, be coolness and safety for Ibrahim." (Surah Al-Anbiya: 21:69)

A miracle occurred, the fire obeyed and burned only his chains. Abraham came out from it as if he was coming out from a garden, peaceful, his face illuminated, and not a trace of smoke on his clothes. People watched in shock and exclaimed: "Amazing! Abraham's God has saved him from the fire!"

### Confrontation with Nimrod

Ibrahim (A.S.) had established a definite reasoning against idolaters. Nothing was left to prove for him except to reason against the rulers who proclaimed themselves gods.

The Quran discusses a certain conversation between an unrighteous ruler and Ibrahim (A.S.). Although in the narration of Quran, name of the king/ruler has not been revealed, many historical sources suggest that it was Nimrod or Namrud.

Nimrod became extremely arrogant due to his wealth and power, to the point that he made the claim that he possessed the power of creation and claimed divinity for himself. Namrud proclaimed himself as a living god and was worshipped as such by his subjects.

Namrud, King of Babylon, felt that his throne was in danger, and that he was losing power because upon witnessing Ibrahim (A.S.) coming out of the fire unharmed, majority of his people started believing in Allah and Ibrahim (A.S.) being a true prophet of Allah. Namrud wanted to debate with Ibrahim (A.S.) and show his people that he, the king, is indeed the god and that Ibrahim (A.S.) was a liar. He feared that the status of godhead he had proclaimed for himself was not challenged by an ordinary human being. In order to safeguard his interests, he summoned Ibrahim (A.S.) to the palace and held a dialogue with him which Allah has narrated in Al-Quran:

    Have you not thought about him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord (Allah) because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said to him: "My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death." 
    He said: "I give life and cause death." 

    Abraham said: "Verily, Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; then cause it you to rise from the west." 

    So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. Allah guides not the people who are Zalimeen (wrongdoers etc).
    Surah Al-Baqarah: 2:258

As mentioned above, Allah deliberately does not mention the name of the king as it is considered unimportant. The Quran also does not mention the long dialogue between Ibrahim (A.S.) and the king.

King did not know what to say and what to do. After Namrud was silenced by Ibrahim (A.S.), he (Ibrahim) left the royal palace. Then the truth of the Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.) spread throughout the land. Humans start talking about his miracle and his salvation from the fire and his arguments with king that made the king speechless.

## Migration of Ibrahim

</summary>

Ibrahim (A.S.) continued calling people to believe in Allah, exerting a great effort to guide his people to the right path. He tried every possible means to convince them. However in spite of his love and care for the people, they did not listen to him and deserted him. Only one woman and one man of his people shared his belief in Allah. The woman was named Sarah who later became his wife while the man was Lut who later became a prophet after him. When Ibrahim (A.S.) realized that no one else was going to believe in his call, he decided to migrate. Before his migration, he invited his father to believe in Allah. He knew that his father was the enemy of Allah and he would not believe. Allah says in Al-Quran:

    And the request of forgiveness of Abraham for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became apparent to Abraham that his father was an enemy to Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed was Abraham compassionate and patient.
    Surah At-Tawbah: 9:114

After going to Palestine, Ibrahim (A.S.) went to Egypt. During this journey Prophet Ibrahim (A.S.) invited people to worship Allah, show them the right path and helped the poor.

There is a hadith about what happened to Ibrahim (A.S.) on his journey. Narrated Abu Huraira (R.A.):

> Abraham did not tell a lie except on three occasion. Twice for the Sake of Allah when he said, "I am sick," and he said, "(I have not done this but) the big idol has done it." The (third was) that while Abraham and Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant. Someone said to the tyrant, "This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very charming lady." 
>
> So, he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, "Who is this lady?" Abraham said, "She is my sister." Abraham went to Sarah and said, "O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I. This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don't contradict my statement." 
>
> The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sarah. "Pray to Allah for me, and I shall not harm you." So Sarah asked Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again requested Sarah, "Pray to Allah for me, and I will not harm you." Sarah asked Allah again and he became alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her) and said, "You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil." 
>
> The tyrant then gave Hajar (Hajrah) as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back (to Abraham) while he was praying. Abraham, gesturing with his hand, asked, "What has happened?" She replied, "Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and gave me Hajar (Hajrah) for service." (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying, "That (Hajarah) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of Ishmael, Hajarah's son). (Bukhari: 3358)

According to some scholars, what was intended by lying in those situations was only to use equivocations -- <span class="tooltip">Tawriyah<span class="tooltiptext"> Tawriya means saying something which has more than one meaning and intending a meaning different from what the listener is likely to understand) rather than explicit lies.</span></span>. The scholars stated that attributing lies to Ibrahim (A.S.) in this context, does not mean explicit lying.

Following are the meaning, according to some other scholars, of these three lies:
1. Ibrahim (A.S.) told his father he was sick in order to avoid going to the temple/festival and indulging in the polygamous practices.
2. After breaking all the idols, Ibrahim (A.S.) placed the axe in the hands of the largest idol. When the people returned and saw that their idols were smashed they accused Ibrahim (A.S.) of being the perpetrator. He, in reply, said that the biggest idol had broken the rest of the statues in order to prove the point that these statues were man-made and not capable of human actions.
3. The tyrant/king wanted Sarah for his own evil intentions and Ibrahim (A.S.) knew that Allah would protect her. Therefore, when the tyrant/king asked who she was, instead of responding that she was his wife, Ibrahim (A.S.) responded that she was his sister in Islam, which she technically was.

## Resurrection of Birds 🐦🐦🐦🐦

</summary>

Ibrahim (A.S.) lived on the earth worshipping Allah, sanctifying Him and calling people to worship Allah and Allah alone. But he knew that his days on earth were limited and that these days would be followed by death and finally resurrection. The knowledge of life after death filled Abraham with peace and love and certitude. One day Ibrahim (AS) asked Allah how dead people will come back on The day of judgment. Allah commanded him to take four birds, tear them apart into pieces and then mix the bodies up. He then divided the mix into four parts and placed each part on the top of four hills. He asked Ibrahim (A.S.) to call back the birds by Allah’s name. Immediately, the birds reassembled to their original parts, came back to life. Allah Has revealed this in Al-Quran:

    Remember when Abraham said: "My Lord Show me how You give life to the dead." Allah said: "Do you not believe?" Abraham said: "Yes I believe, but to be stronger in Faith." He said: "Take four birds, the cause them to incline towards you (then slaughter them, cut them into pieces) and then put a portion of them on every hill and call them they will come to you in haste. And know that Allah is All Mighty and All Wise." 
    Quran, Surah Al-Baqarah 2:260

Ibrahim (A.S.) is the only person that the Quran commands our prophet to look up to as a role model. Allah Says in Al-Quran:
pired you (O Muhammad): "Follow the religion of Ibrahim (Abraham) Haneefa" (Islamic Monotheism – to worship none but Allah)
    Surah An-Nahl 16:123

## Soddom and Homorra 🏳️‍🌈: Story of Lut

</summary>

Lut (لوط, ), known as Lot in the Old Testament, is a prophet of God in the Quran. According to Islamic tradition, Lut was born in Haran and spent his younger years in Ur, later migrating to Canaan with his uncle Abraham. He was sent to the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a prophet, and was commanded to preach to their inhabitants on monotheism and the sinfulness of homosexuality 🏳️‍🌈 and their lustful and violent acts.

Though Lut was not born among the people he'd been sent to preach to, the people of Sodom are still regarded as his "brethren" in the Quran. Like the Biblical narrative, the Quran states that Lut's messages were ignored by the inhabitants of the cities, and Sodom and Gomorrah were subsequently destroyed. The destruction of the cities is traditionally presented as a warning against male rape and went on to be used as a warning against homosexual acts.

While the Quran does not elaborate upon Lut's later life, Islam holds that all prophets were examples of moral and spiritual righteousness.

Lut is referenced a relatively large number of times in the Quran. Many of these passages place the narrative of Lut in a line of successive prophets including Noah, Hud, Salih and Shuayb. Islamic scholars have stated that these particular prophets represent the early cycle of prophecy as described in the Quran. These narratives typically follow similar patterns: a prophet is sent to a community; the community pays no heed to his warnings instead threatens him with punishment; God asks the prophet to leave with his followers the community and its people are subsequently destroyed in a punishment. Elsewhere in the Quran, Lut is mentioned alongside Ishmael, Elisha and Jonah as men whom God favored above the nations.

The Quran states that Lut was a nephew of Abraham who had been sent to the twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah as a prophet after migrating to Canaan, but he was rejected by the cities' inhabitants. One day, a group of angels visited Abraham as guests in the guise of handsome men in order to inform him of the fact that his wife Sarah was pregnant with Isaac. While there, they also told him that they had been sent by God to the "guilty people" of Lut to destroy them with "a shower of stones of clay". Lut and those who believed in him, were to be spared, but his wife was to die in the destruction, with the angels stating that "she is of those who lag behind". The Quran also draws upon Lot's wife as an "example for the unbelievers" as she was married to a righteous man but refused to believe in his message and was thus condemned to Hell.

The people of the twin cities transgressed against the bounds of God. According to the Quran, their sins included inhospitality and robbery  they hated strangers and robbed travellers, apart from other abuses and rape. It was their sin of sexual misconduct as well which was seen as particularly egregious, with Lut strongly chiding them for approaching men with sexual desire instead of women. Lut told and tried to help them to abandon their sinful ways, but they ridiculed him and threatened to evict him from the cities. Lut prayed to God and begged to be saved from the consequences of their sinful acts.

### Angels appear to Lut
Then three Angels in the disguise of handsome young boys came to Lot, who became distressed knowing the character of the people, and feeling himself powerless to protect the visitors; he said: "This is a distressful day." When the people - overjoyed at the news of new young boys in the village - came to snatch them away from Lot, he tried to convince them to refrain from practising their lusts on the visitors, and offered his own daughters in marriage to them in return for the boys' free release, but they were unrelenting and replied "we have no need of your daughters: indeed you know quite well what we want!" The Qur'an remarks "... they moved blindly in the frenzy of approaching death".

### Prophet Lut advised to leave the place
Lot was powerless to protect the young boys, but they revealed to him that they were indeed Angels sent by Allah to punish the people for their transgressions. They advised Lot to leave the place during the night and not look back, informing him that his wife would be left behind on account of her sinful nature and that they "...were about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from the sky because they are evil-doers". Keeping his faith in Allah, Lot left his home and the cities during the night with his family and others who believed in him, and only his wife stayed behind.

The exegetes Ibn Kathir, Qurtubi and Tabari do not read 'daughters' to mean Lot's literal daughters. They argue that since a prophet is like a father to his nation, Lot was directing the evildoers to turn away from their sins and engage in healthy and pious relationships with the daughters of the nation, i.e. women in general.

The angels then revealed their true identities to Lot and said to him, “We are (here) to deliver thee and thy following, except thy wife: she is of those who lag behind." They advised Lot to leave the cities during the night, telling him not to look back. Keeping his faith in God, Lot left the cities in the darkness of night, bringing with him his followers and believing family members. Finally, morning came, and the Decree of God passed whereupon the Quran reads, “We turned (the cities) upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer,-“ And thus was sealed the fate of the twin cities, falling into destruction and despair and marking the end of the civilisations of Sodom and Gomorrah.

    And Lot, who said to his nation: 'Do you commit such indecency (sodomy) in a way that no one has preceded you in the worlds? You approach men lustfully instead of women. Truly, you are a nation who exceed (in sin).' The only answer of his nation was: 'Expel them from your village. They are people who keep themselves purified.' We saved him and all his family, except his wife, who was made to remain, and We rained down upon them a rain. So look how was the end of the evildoers.
    Qur'an 7:80-84

The Quran, in the following passage, suggests that Ibrahim and Sarah found out about the destruction of Lot’s people after being given the good news of having a son:

    And when Our envoys brought Abraham the good news, they said, "We are going to destroy the people of this town; its people are wrongdoers."

    He said, "Yet Lot is in it." They said, "We are well aware of who is in it. We will save him, and his family, except for his wife, who will remain behind."
    The Quran, verses 29:31-32

### Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
When morning came, Allah 'turned the cities upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay, spread, layer on layer' putting an end to the lives of the people and describing it as "So taste ye My Wrath and My Warning!" in the Qur'an. The Qur'an refers to the sites of Sodom and Gomorrah as 'signs for those who understand by example', those who 'care to understand' and those who 'fear a grievous penalty or a painful doom'. The Qur'an also uses the story as an example stating: 

    "And most surely you pass by them (the cities) by the day, and at night; do you not then understand?"

There is a narration that Jibril participated in the desctruction of the cities.

### Differences in stories of the Qur'an and the Bible
The major difference between the story of Lut in the Qur'an and the story of Lot in the Bible is that the Biblical version includes a story of Lot's being induced to incestuous relations with his own daughters. The Qur'an says that Lut is a prophet, and holds that all Prophets were examples of moral and spiritual rectitude. Though it is not altogether clear in the Bible story that Lot consented to his action, in Islam these stories of incest are thus considered to be false.

Sodom and Gomorrah are not mentioned by name in the Qur'an. The Islamic use of the term Sodomite was borrowed therefrom by the Ulama(Scholars) of Islamic law which teach that capital punishment/or flogging is the penalty for this action to be meted out on both the sodomite (the penetrator) and the catamite (the receptive member). These punishments were adopted by the blooming Islamic Empires approximately two centuries after the death of the Prophet Muhammad according to oral traditions and they are not Sunnah.

## Birth of Ismail

</summary>

Sarah knew that her husband, Ibrahim (A.S.), was longing for a child. As Allah has mentioned Ibrahim’s (A.S.) dua in Quran:

    "O my Lord! Grant me a righteous son!"
    So We gave him the good news of a forbearing son.
    Quran, Surah Al Saffat 37:100-101

She also knew that she was getting old and may not be able to provide Ibrahim (A.S.) with a child. She suggested to Ibrahim (A.S.) that he should marry her servant Hajar and maybe Allah would bless them with a child through her. Ibrahim (A.S.) accepted the advice of his beloved wife Sarah and married Hajar. It wasn’t long before Ibrahim (A.S.) and Hajar were blessed with a baby boy whom they named Ishmael/Ismail. Ibrahim (A.S.) was overjoyed with happiness at the birth of his first son. They all celebrated and thanked Allah for such a great and beautiful blessing. Some scholars say that Ibrahim (A.S.) was 86 years old at the time of Ismail’s birth.

## The Covenant

</summary>

When Abraham was in old ages, three angels come to Abraham and bring them the good news that Sarah will conveive a child. Sarah laughs because she is very old but angels tell her that this is the will of God. 

    When they entered upon him, and said, "Peace." He said, "We are wary of you."
    
    They said, "Do not fear; we bring you good news of a boy endowed with knowledge."
    
    He said, "Do you bring me good news, when old age has overtaken me? What good news do you bring?"

    They said, "We bring you good news in truth, so do not despair."

    He said, "And who despairs of his Lord’s mercy but the lost?"

    He said, "So what is your business, O envoys?"

    They said, "We were sent to a sinful people." 
    The Quran, verses 15:52-58

God made his covenant with Abram thirteen years after the birth of Ishmael. Abram's name was changed to Abraham and Sarai's to Sarah. The covenant was sealed by Abraham's Circumcision, and the first commandment relating to circumcision. Ishmael was also circumcised on that day, at the age of 13, as were the other men of Abraham's household.

God says that the sign of the covenant is circumcision. Circumcision is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males. Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative, the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews. The procedure is not explicitly mentioned in the Quran, however, it is a tradition established by Islam's prophet Muhammad directly (following Abraham), and so its practice is considered a sunnah (prophet's tradition) and is very important in Islam. For Muslims, circumcision is also a matter of cleanliness, purification and control over one's baser self (nafs).

Accrding to Genesis, The Lord said to Abraham “ go from the country and your kindred and your fathers house to the land that I will show you.” And I will make of you a great nation and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you. And by you all the families of the earth shall bless themselves." At this time Abraham was promised not only many descendants, but descendants through Sarah specifically, as well as the land where he was living, which was to belong to his descendants. The covenant was to be fulfilled through Isaac (Promised land of Canaan for Isaac), though God promised that Ishmael would become a great nation as well. The covenant of circumcision (unlike the earlier promise) was two-sided and conditional: if Abraham and his descendants fulfilled their part of the covenant, Yahweh would be their God, give them the land, and make a great nation and kings out of Abraham's line.

The promise of a son to Abraham made Sarah "laugh," which became the name of the son of promise, Isaac (Ishaq).

## Iskhaq (Isaac): Father of Jewish people

</summary>

Iskhaq (Isaac) is the second son of Ibrahim. His mother is Sarah. Iskhaq's son Yacub (Jacob) who is later renamed to Israel is the father of 12 Jewish tribes.

According to Bible: As had been prophesied in the Mamre valley the previous year, Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham on the first anniversary of the covenant of circumcision. Isaac continued to grow and on the day he was weaned, Abraham held a great feast to honor the occasion.

Isaac, along with Ishmael, is highly important for Muslims for continuing to preach the message of monotheism after his father Abraham. Among Isaac's children was the follow-up Israelite patriarch Jacob, who is also venerated as an Islamic prophet.

Iskhaq is the father of Yaqub (Jacob) and grandfather of Yusuf (Joseph). Ishaq and Rebecca are parents of Jacob and Esau.

Islam considers Isaac (اسحاق ) a prophet of Islam, and describes him as the father of the Israelites and a righteous servant of God.

Isaac is mentioned seventeen times by name in the Quran, often with his father and his son, Jacob. The Quran states that Abraham received "good tidings of Isaac, a prophet, of the righteous", and that God blessed them both (37: 112). In a fuller description, when angels came to Abraham to tell him of the future punishment to be imposed on Sodom and Gomorrah, his wife, Sarah, "laughed, and We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac of (a grandson) Jacob" (11: 71–74); and it is further explained that this event will take place despite Abraham and Sarah's old age. Several verses speak of Isaac as a "gift" to Abraham (6: 84; 14: 49–50), and 24: 26–27 adds that God made "prophethood and the Book to be among his offspring", which has been interpreted to refer to Abraham's two prophetic sons, his prophetic grandson Jacob, and his prophetic great-grandson Joseph. In the Quran, it later narrates that Abraham also praised God for giving him Ishmael and Isaac in his old age (14: 39–41).

Elsewhere in the Quran, Isaac is mentioned in lists: Joseph follows the religion of his forefathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (12: 38) and speaks of God's favor to them (12: 6); Jacob's sons all testify their faith and promise to worship the God that their forefathers, "Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac", worshiped (2: 127); and the Quran commands Muslims to believe in the revelations that were given to "Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob and the Patriarchs" (2: 136; 3: 84). In the Quran's narrative of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son (37: 102), the name of the son is not mentioned and debate has continued over the son's identity, though many feel that the identity is the least important element in a story which is given to show the courage that one develops through faith.

The Quran mentions Isaac as a prophet and a righteous man of God. Isaac and Jacob are mentioned as being bestowed upon Abraham as gifts of God, who then worshipped God only and were righteous leaders in the way of God:

    And We bestowed on him Isaac and, as an additional gift, (a grandson), Jacob, and We made righteous men of every one (of them).
    And We made them leaders, guiding (men) by Our Command, and We sent them inspiration to do good deeds, to establish regular prayers, and to practise regular charity; and they constantly served Us (and Us only).
    Quran, sura 21 (Al-Anbiya), ayah 72–73
    
    And We gave him the glad tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, and one of the righteous.
    Quran, sura 37 (As-Saaffat), ayah 112

## Hajar and Ismail are sent to Mecca

</summary>

After having her own son, Sarah tells Abraham to send away Hajar and Ismail so that Ismail doesn't cause a threat to the inheritance of Ishaq. According to Bible, during celebration of Iskhaq'a weaning, Sarah found Ishmael mocking; an observation that would begin to clarify the birthright of Isaac. God also tells Abraham to send them away and he leaves them in emtpy lands which will later become the city of Mecca.

Allah commanded Prophet Ibrahim  to leave his second wife, Hajar and their newly born son, Ismail, alone in an un-inhabited, barren valley. So, Ibrahim  asked his wife, Hajar to prepare for a long journey. 

### Settling in Mecca

Ibrahim takes Hajar and Ismail and they depart. They walked through cultivated land, deserts and mountains, until they reached the desert of the Arabian peninsula and came to a valley having no fruit, no trees, no food and no water; the valley had no sign of life. Acording to narrations, the Sakina (something like a wind or spirit sent by God), or the angel Gabriel (Jibril) guides them to the location of the Kaaba, at which point Abraham leaves the his wife and son. It is said that Hajar asks Abraham who he is entrusting herself and Ishmael to as he leaves them. He answers that he is entrusting them to God, to which Hajar then makes a reply that shows her faith, stating that she believes God will guide them. 

Ibn Abbas  narrated:

> "... Ibrahim  brought her (Hajar) and her son, Ismail while she was suckling him, to a place near the Kaaba under a tree on the spot of Zam-Zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ismail's mother followed him saying: "O Ibrahim! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?" She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him: "Has Allah ordered you to do so?" He said: "Yes". She said: "Then He will not neglect us." and she returned (to her child) while Ibrahim proceeded on his way. On reaching the Thaniya (mountain) where they could not see him, Ibrahim  faced the Kaaba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayer:"O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Thy Sacred House; in order, O our Lord, that they may establish regular Prayer: so fill the hearts of some among men with love towards them, and feed them with fruits: so that they may give thanks." [Surah Ibrahim 14:37]..." [Sahih Bukhari Book# 55, Hadith# 583]
 
### Safa and Marwah

After some time in the desert, Hajar and Ishmael run out of water and Ishmael becomes extremely thirsty. Hajar is distressed and searches for water, running back and forth seven times between the hills of **Al-Safa** and **Al-Marwah** to see if there's caravan. Hajar is later remembered by Muslims for this act during the Hajj, or pilgrimage, in which Muslims run between these same hills as part of the Sa'yee.

</details><details><summary>

## Discovery of Zamzam Well

</summary>

While Hajar is running from one hill to the other, God sends them an angel that tells Hajar that God hears Ishmael crying.

When she returns to Ishmael, she finds either him or an angel scratching the ground with their heel or finger, whereupon water begins flowing and Hajar collects some or dams it up. This spring or well is known as Zamzam which fulfills the thirst of piligrims in Mecca p to recent days. The name of the well comes from the phrase Zomë Zomë, meaning "stop flowing", a command repeated by Hajar during her attempt to contain the spring water. 

> The Prophet (PBUH) said, "The best water on the face of the earth is the water of Zamzam; it is a kind of food and a healing from sickness."
>Saheeh al-Jaami, 3302

## Ismail (Ishmael): Father of Arab people

</summary>

First son of Ibrahim.

Ismael (Yishmael means "God will hear") is regarded as a prophet and messenger and the founder of Ishmaelites in Islam. He is the son of Ibrahim (Abraham), born to Hājar (Hagar). Ismail is also associated with Mecca and the construction of the Kaaba. Ismail is considered the ancestor to the prophet Muhammad ﷺ. .

Ismail is the figure known as Ishmael in Judaism and Christianity. These sources include the Quran, Quranic commentary (tafsir), hadith, historiographic collections like that of Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, and Isra'iliyat (Islamic texts about Biblical or ancient Israelite figures that originate from Jewish or Christian sources).

### Ismail and Hajar taken to Mecca by Ibrahim

Ibrahim, Bibi Hajar and Ismail came across the Makkah Valley. Ibrahim left his wife and infant son near the mount that now covered the Sacred House, under the divine instruction, leaving them with a few dates and a jar of water. Ismail and Hajar being taken to Mecca by Abraham in Islamic texts is an important part in the story of Ismail, as it brings the focus to Mecca and is the beginning of Mecca's sanctification as a holy area. Islamic tradition says Abraham was ordered by God to take Hajar and Ismail to Mecca, and later Ibrahim returned to Mecca to build the Kaaba.

When Hajar ran out of food and water, she left the baby under the sheltered place and ran here and there in search of help or water. She ran toward the hilltop of Safa but didnot locate any sign of spring or habitation. Next, she ran to the neighboring hill, Marwah but again she found nothing. And Allah consoles her and sends angels to them and they find the well of Zamzam.

At some point, a passing tribe known as the Jurhum sees birds circling the water and investigates. They ask Hajar if they can settle there, which she allows, and many versions say as Ismail grew up he learned various things from the tribe. There are numerous versions of this story, each differing in various ways. The versions used in this summary, as well as others, can be found in al-Tabari's history and are recounted in Reuven Firestone's Journeys in Holy Lands.

The word Ismail إسماعيل mentioned 12 times in Quran in 12 verses. And he is praised by Allah multiple times.

    And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot – and all [of them] We preferred over the worlds.
    Quran 38:48

    And [mention] Ishmael and Idrees and Dhul-Kifl; all were of the patient.
    Quran 21:85

    And remember Ishmael, Elisha and Dhul-Kifl, and all are among the outstanding.
    Quran 38:48

There is a narration about how Ismail's wifes. At some point, often believed to be after Hajar's death, Ismail married a woman from the Jurhum, the tribe who settled in the area around Zamzam. Ibrahim visited Ismail in Mecca and when he arrived at his home, Ismail was not there. Instead Ismail's wife greets Ibrahim, but she was not welcoming or generous to him. Ibrahim instructed her to tell Ismail some version of the statement that he was not pleased with or to change "the threshold of his door." When Ismail returns home and his wife told him that, he knows it is from his father and taking the advice, divorced the woman. He then married another woman from Jurhum. Ibrahim once again visited and was met by Ismail's second wife, as Ismail was out. This wife was very kind and provided food for him. Ibrahim instructed her to tell Ismail some version of the statement that he was pleased with "the threshold of his door." When Ismail arrived and his wife repeated Ibrahim's statement, Ismail knew it was from his father and kept his wife.

The Bible also says that Ishmael will have so many descendants that it will be difficult to count.

### Prophetic career

Ismail is considered a prophet in Islam and is listed in the Quran with other prophets in many instances. In other verses, such as 21:85 and 38:48, Ismail is praised for being patient, good, and righteous. A particular example which describes Ismail individually is 19:54-55 – "And call to mind, through this divine writ, Ismail. Behold, he was always true to his promise, and was an apostle [of God], a prophet, who used to enjoin upon his people prayer and charity, and found favour in his Sustainer's sight." As a descendant of Ismail, Muhammadﷺ.  is considered justified as the Prophet and continues the line of prophets from pre-Islamic times.

### Genealogy and association with Arabs

Ishmael's place as the "founder of the Arabs" was first stated by Josephus. As Islam became established, the figure Ishmael and those descended from him, the Ishmaelites, became connected, and often equated, with the term Arab in early Jewish and Christian literature. Before Islam developed as a religion, Ishmael was depicted in many ways, but after its establishment, Ishmael was almost always seen in a negative light in Jewish and Christian texts, as he becomes the symbol for the "other" in these religions. As the Islamic community became more powerful, some Jewish midrash about Ishmael was modified so that he was portrayed more negatively in order to challenge the Islamic view that Ishmael, and thus the Muslims, were the favoured descendants of Abraham. This became the genealogy according to Jewish sources and the Bible, in contrast with the genealogy of Arabs according to Muslims. The development of Islam created pressure for Islam to be somehow different from Judaism and Christianity, and accordingly, Ishmael's lineage to Arabs was stressed.

In pre-Islamic times, there were three distinct groups of Arabs- the Ba'ida, Ariba, and Musta'riba. The Ba'ida were the "legendary Arabs of the past," while the Ariba were the "Southern Arabs." Ishmael's descendants became the Northern Arabs known as the Musta'riba or the "Arabized Arabs." The Musta'riba were described as Arabized since it is believed Ishmael learned Arabic when he moved to Mecca and married into the Arabic tribe of Jurhum. Ishmael's line is then traced from his son Kedar, then down through to Adnan, then to the Musta'riba, to the Quraysh.  In this manner, Muhammad's ﷺ.  ancestry leads back to Ishmael, joining "original biblical ancestry of Abraham with a distinctively Arab afinal stock," and connecting prophet Muhammad ﷺ.  with Mecca and the Kaaba.

## Construction of the Kaaba 🕋

</summary>

God had ordered Adam to build the Kaaba after his fall from the Garden of Eden. However, years had passed, the Kaaba was heavily damaged in the long course of time and was almost demolished. Therefore, God showed Ibrahim where the Kaaba was and ordered him and his son Ismail to build it once again. The Kaaba was in the same region Ibrahim left Hajar and Ismail, that is, Mecca.The prophet Ibrahim (PBUH) received an order from Allah Almighty to rebuild this holy structure and immediately set to work with his son Ismael.

There are many versions of the construction of the Kaaba that differ in fairly significant ways, although all have Ibrahim build or cleanse the Kaaba and then immediately after, or at an unknown time, God called Ibrahim to establish the Hajj, or pilgrimage. These narratives differ in when these events occurred, if and how there was supernatural involvement, the inclusion or omission of the Black Stone, and whether Ismail assisted his father. Of those that say Ismail took part in the construction, most describe Ibrahim visited Ismail a third time in Mecca, during which they raised the Kaaba. Some say Ismail looked for a final stone, but Ibrahim did not accept the one he brought back. Instead an angel had brought the Black Stone, which Ibrahim put into place. Ismail was left at the Kaaba, in charge of its care and to teach others about the Hajj. The starting of the Hajj has many versions, and some scholars believe this reflects the late association of Ibrahim with the Hajj after Islam had developed to help remove its connection to early pagan rituals.

Adam's altar and the stone were said to have been lost during Noah's Flood and forgotten. Ibrahim (Abraham) was said to have later found the Black Stone at the original site of Adam's altar when the angel Jibrail revealed it to him. Ibrahim ordered his son Ismael to build a new temple, the Kaaba, into which the stone was to be embedded.

    وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَنْ طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ

    And [mention] when We made the House a place of return for the people and [a place of] security. And take, [O believers], from the standing place of Abraham a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, [saying], “Purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who are staying [there] for worship and those who bow and prostrate [in prayer].
    Quran 2:125

Then when the time for building the Ka'bah came, during one of Ibrahim's subsequent visits from Sham (Syria and Palestine) to Makkah and his family, he said to his son Isma'il: "O Isma'il! Allah has given me an order." Isma'il said: "Do what your Lord has ordered you to do." Ibrahim asked: "Will you help me?" Isma'il said: "I will help you." Ibrahim said: "Allah has ordered me to build a house here," pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it. The Prophet (pbuh) added: "Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e., the Ka'bah). Isma'il brought the stones and Ibrahim was building, and when the walls became high, Isma'il brought this stone and put it for Ibrahim who stood over it and carried on building, while Isma'il was handing him the stones, and both of them were praying to Allah to accept their service.

      وَإِذْ يَرْفَعُ إِبْرَاهِيمُ الْقَوَاعِدَ مِنَ الْبَيْتِ وَإِسْمَاعِيلُ
    And [mention] when Abraham was raising the foundations of the House and [with him] Ishmael, [saying], “Our Lord, accept [this] from us. Indeed You are the Hearing, the Knowing.
    Quran 2:127

The stone over which Ibrahim stood and built is called maqam Ibrahim (Ibrahim's station). It is still in existence today and is revered by all Muslims. Even some religious rituals are directly associated with it. Just like Prophet Adam, Ibrahim, too, is said to have built the Ka'bah using building materials from five special earthly mounts: Hira', Tur Sina', Tur Zayta', Jabal Lubnan and al-Judiyy. For the foundations, he used only materials from Hira' (or the Nur hill), where Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) received his first revelation.

If the last account entails any symbolic significance, then it will be with respect to the notion that it was emblematically appropriate to use materials for the Ka'bah groundwork or foundations from a hill where the final prophethood contact between the heavens and the earth was made, and where Prophet Muhammad's mission officially commenced. Such was an occurrence that, as a matter of fact, signified the climax of Ibrahim's own mission and efforts, because he besought God to make happen that which indeed many centuries later started to happen on the Hira' (Nur) hill in the Hira' cave. It therefore was not by chance that in the course of constructing the Ka'bah Ibrahim prayed to God about Muhammad (pbuh) and about the substance of his forthcoming mission.

Having completed to build Kaba, they opened their hands in supplication to Allah Almighty and prayed:

    "Our Lord! Send a Messenger from our progeny to the Muslim Ummah so that he can read to them your ayahs (verses), teach them your books and their laws, and cleanse them from their sins!" 
    Surah al-Baqara, 129

Hence, Ibrahim laid the spiritual foundation of Prophet Muhammad's mission by invoking God to send him, and by (re)building the Ka'bah, the epicenter and nucleus of Muhammad's prophethood and his overall spiritual and civilizational legacy. Making the matter more perceptible, suggestive and redolent with meaning, Ibrahim used the Hira or Nur hill resources for the groundwork of the Ka'bah.

Allah Almighty did not leave this sincere supplication unanswered and sent a descendant of Ismael, the prophet Muhammad ﷺ, , the chief of the prophets to the world. The Pride of the Universe ﷺ  proclaimed this truth as,

> "I am the supplication of my forefather Ibrahim (pbuh)."
> Ibn Hisham, Sira: 1/175; Tabari, Tarikh: 2/128.

### The Black Stone

The Black Stone was given to Ibrahim from Jannah to be placed on the corner of the Holy Kaaba. Abd Allah Ibn Abbas – a cousin of Prophet Muhammad narrated that the Prophet said: 

> "The Black Stone came down from Paradise and it was whiter than milk, but the sins of the sons of Adam turned it black."

The Black Stone carries greater importance, as according to an account, it is known that while Ibrahim AS was building the house of God, the Holy Kaaba, for spirituality and worship, it appeared that the stones to complete the wall were short. The Prophet Ibrahim sent his son Prophet Ismail AS to look for an appropriate stone to fit in the gap to finish the Holy wall of Kaaba. When he came back empty-handed, he noticed a shiny white colour stone already placed in the empty space. Ibrahim AS told him the unique stone was delivered to him by Jibreel.

## Ibrahim sacrifices a ram 🐑

</summary>

Ismail and his mother lived in Mecca while Ibrahim would sometimes visit them. When Ismail grew to be a fine young man, Ibrahim had a dream:

    When he was old enough to assist in his endeavour, he said, "My son! I see in dreams that I am sacrificing you. See what you think." He said, "Father! Do whatever you have been commanded. If Allah wishes, you will find me to be patient."

When prophets dream of something, it is the same as revelation. Therefore, when Prophet Ibrahim has a dream that he is sacrificing his son, it is in fact God’s command. Besides, the dream was a means for testing Ibrahim.

The story continues:

    So when they had both surrendered [to Allah’s will], and he had laid him down on his forehead,
    We called out to him, "O Abraham!
    You have indeed fulfilled your vision! Thus indeed do We reward the virtuous!
    This was indeed a manifest test."

    Then We ransomed him with a great sacrifice,
    and left for him a good name in posterity.

According to Quranic commentators God sent a ram to be sacrificed in his stead. Therefore, people came to call Ismail Dhabīḥullāh, meaning the one sacrificed for Allah. Jews say that Isaac was the son of Ibrahim whom he wanted to sacrifice, but according to the Quran this is wrong. Even though Ismail’s name is not mentioned, God gives the good news of his birth by calling him a forbearing son in verse 101 of chapter 37. After the story of the sacrifice is told, in the next verses God gives Ibrahim the good news of the birth of Isaac:

    "Peace be to Abraham!"
    Thus do We reward the virtuous.
    He is indeed one of Our faithful servants.
    And We gave him the good news of [the birth of] Isaac, a prophet, one of the righteous.

Therefore, the forbearing son that God gave the news of his birth first in verse 101 was Ismail as Ibrahim had only two sons, and verse 112 gives the good news of Isaac after telling the story of the sacrifice. As a result, it becomes clear that the forbearing son, that is, Ismail was the one who was to be sacrificed.

As Ibrahim attempts to slay Ismail, either the knife is turned over in his hand or copper appears on Ismail to prevent the death and God tells Ibrahim that he has fulfilled the command. Unlike in the Bible, there is no mention in the Qur'an of an animal (ram) replacing the boy; rather he is replaced with a 'great sacrifice' (dhibḥin ʿaẓīm). Since the sacrifice of a ram cannot be greater than that of Ibrahim's son (and a prophet in Islam at that), this replacement seems to point to either the religious institutionalisation of sacrifice itself, or to the future self-sacrifices of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his companions (who were destined to emerge from the progeny of Ismail) in the cause of their faith. Every Eid al-Adha once a year Muslims around the world slaughter an animal to commemorate Ibrahim's sacrifice and to remind themselves of self-abnegation in the way of Allah. Later historiographic literature incorporates the Biblical narrative in which a ram is provided which is slaughtered instead of Ismail.

The actions of Ismail in this narrative have led him to become a prominent model of hospitality and obedience. This story in the Quran is unique when compared to that in the Bible because Ibrahim talks with his son, whichever it is believed to be, and the son is thus aware of the plan to become a sacrifice and approves of it. As noted above, in some versions, Ismail makes sure in different ways that neither he nor his father hesitate in their obedience to God. In this way, Ismail is a model of surrendering one's will to God, an essential characteristic in Islam.

In looking solely at the text of the Quran to determine which son was to be sacrificed, there still are various views. The strongest case for Ismail in the Quran is that directly after the sacrifice narrative, Ibrahim is told of the coming of Isaac's birth, therefore, it must be Ismail who was about to be sacrificed. However Tabari argues that because it is only Isaac who is indicated by birth announcements that the announcement at the start of the sacrifice narrative, "So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy" refers to Isaac. Authentic hadiths are said to not contradict each other because that negates the definition of the hadith.

## Yaqub -- Jacob and 12 Jewish tribes

</summary>
> Jacob was later renamed to Israel and became a father of 12 Jewish tribes.

### Yaqub in the Quran and Hadith

Two further references to Isra'il ( إِسْرَآئِیل ; ) are believed to be mention of Jacob. The Arabic form Ya'qūb.

He is recognized in Islam as a prophet who received inspiration from God. He is acknowledged as a patriarch of Islam. Muslims believe that he preached the same monotheistic faith as his forefathers ʾIbrāhīm, ʾIsḥāq and Ismā'īl. Yaqub is mentioned 16 times in the Quran. In the majority of these references, Yaqub is mentioned alongside fellow prophets and patriarchs as an ancient and pious prophet. According to the Quran, Yaqub remained in the company of the elect throughout his life. (38:47) The Quran specifically mentions that Yaqub was guided (6:84) and inspired (4:163) and was chosen to enforce the awareness of the Hereafter. (38:46) Yaqub is described as a good-doer (21:72) and the Quran further makes it clear that God inspired Yaqub to contribute towards purification and hold the contact prayer. (21:73) Yaqub is further described as being resourceful and a possessor of great vision (38:45) and is further spoken of as being granted a "tongue [voice] of truthfulness to be heard." (19:50)

Of the life of Yaqub, the Quran narrates two especially important events. The first is the role he plays in the story of his son Yusuf. The Quran narrates the story of Yusuf in detail, and Yaqub, being Yusuf's father, is mentioned thrice and is referenced another 25 times. In the narrative, Yaqub does not trust some of his older sons (12: 11, 18, 23) because they do not respect him. (12: 8, 16–17) Yaqub's prophetic nature is evident from his foreknowledge of Yusuf's future greatness (12:6), his foreboding and response to the supposed death of Yusuf (12: 13, 18) and in his response to the sons' plight in Egypt. (12: 83, 86–87, 96) Islamic literature fleshes out the narrative of Yaqub, and mentions that his wives included Rachel. Yaqub is later mentioned in the Quran in the context of the promise bestowed to Zechariah, regarding the birth of John the Baptist. (19:6) Yaqub's second mention is in the Quran's second chapter. As Yaqub lay on his deathbed, he asked his 12 sons to testify their faith to him before he departed from this world to the next. (2:132) Each son testified in front of Yaqub that they would promise to remain Muslim (in submission to God) until the day of their death, that is they would surrender their wholeselves to God alone and would worship only Him.

In contrast to the Judeo-Christian view of Yaqub, one main difference is that the story of Yaqub's blessing, in which he deceives Isaac, is not accepted in Islam. The Quran makes it clear that Yaqub was blessed by God as a prophet and, therefore, Muslims believe that his father, being a prophet as well, also knew of his son's greatness. Yaqub is also cited in the Hadith as an example of one who was patient and trusting in God in the face of suffering.

### Yaqub in the Bible

The biblical account of the life of Jacob is found in the Book of Genesis, chapters 25–50.

#### Birth

Jacob and his twin brother, Esau, were born to Isaac and Rebecca after 20 years of marriage, when Isaac was 60 years of age. Rebecca was uncomfortable during her pregnancy and went to inquire of God why she was suffering. She received the prophecy that twins were fighting in her womb and would continue to fight all their lives, even after they became two separate nations. The prophecy also said that "the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger" (Genesis 25:25 KJV).

When the time came for Rebecca to give birth, the firstborn, Esau, came out covered with red hair, as if he were wearing a hairy garment, and his heel was grasped by the hand of Jacob, the secondborn. According to Genesis 25, Isaac and Rebecca named the first son Hebrew: Esau. The second son they named Jacob (Ya'aqob or Ya'aqov, meaning "heel-catcher", "supplanter", "leg-puller", "he who follows upon the heels of one").

The boys displayed very different natures as they matured. "... and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; but Jacob was a simple man, dwelling in tents". Moreover, the attitudes of their parents toward them also differed: "And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebecca loved Jacob."

#### Blessing of Isaac

As Isaac aged, he became blind and was uncertain when he would die, so he decided to bestow Esau's birthright upon him. He requested that Esau go out to the fields with his weapons (quiver and bow) to kill some venison. Isaac then requested that Esau make "savory meat" for him out of the venison, according to the way he enjoyed it the most, so that he could eat it and bless Esau.

Rebecca overheard this conversation. It is suggested that she realized prophetically that Isaac's blessings would go to Jacob, since she was told before the twins' birth that the older son would serve the younger.

The Bible tells the story of how Rebecca and Jacob deceived blind Isaac to get the blessing instead of Esau. In the Muslim tradition we believe that Iskhaq and Yaqub being prophets would not do so.

## Yusuf -- Joseph

</summary>

Yusuf ibn Yaqub ibn Ishaaq ibn Ibrahim (Joseph, son of Jacob, son of Isaac, son of Ibrahim) is a prophet mentioned in the Quran, and corresponds to Joseph, a person from the Tanakh, the Jewish religious scripture, and the Christian Bible, who was estimated to have lived in Egypt before the New Kingdom. It is one of the common names in the Middle East and among Muslim nations. Of all of Jacob's children, Yusuf was the one given the gift of prophecy. Although the narratives of other prophets are mentioned in various Surahs, the complete narrative of Yusuf is given only in one Surah, Yusuf, making it unique. It is said to be the most detailed narrative in the Qur'an and bears more details than the Biblical counterpart.

Yusuf is believed to have been the eleventh son of Yaqub, and, according to many scholars, his favorite. According to Ibn Kathir, "Jacob had twelve sons who were the eponymous ancestors of the tribes of the Israelites. The noblest, the most exalted, the greatest of them was Yusuf." The story begins with Yusuf revealing a dream he had to his father, which Jacob recognizes. In addition to the role of God in his life, the story of Yusuf and Zulaikha (Potiphar's wife of the Old Testament) became a popular subject in Persian literature, where it became considerably elaborated over the centuries.

The story of Yusuf in the Qurʾān is a continuous narrative. There are more than one hundred verses, and in totality they encompass many years and "present an amazing variety of sciences and characters in a tightly-knit plot, and offer a dramatic illustration of some of the fundamental themes of the Qurʾān." The Qurʾān itself relates to the story's importance in the third verse: "and We narrate unto you aḥsanal-qaṣaṣ (Arabic: أحسن ٱلقصص, "best (or most beautiful) of stories")." Most scholars believe this is referring to Yusuf's story, while others, including Ṭabari, argue it is a reference to the Qurʾān as a whole. It asserts and documents the execution of God's rulings despite the challenge of human intervention (`And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not`).

This is what the story of Yūsuf confirms categorically, for it ends with comfort and marvels, which is described in the Qurʾān. Along with the story there is also some commentary from some leading scholars of Islam.

### Yusuf before the dream

Muhammad at-Ṭabari provides exquisite detail and commentary of this narrative in his chapter on Yusuf relaying the opinions of well-known scholars. In Ṭabari's chapter, the physical beauty of Yusuf and his mother Rahyl is introduced, in that they were said to have had "more beauty than any other human being." His father, Yaqub, had given him to his oldest sister to be raised. Ṭabari comments that there was no greater love than what Yusuf's aunt felt for him as she had raised him as her own.

### The dream

The story begins with a dream and ends with its interpretation. As the sun appeared over the horizon, bathing the earth in its morning glory, Yusuf, son of Yaqub awoke from his sleep, delighted by a pleasant dream he had. Filled with excitement he ran to his father and reported what he had seen.

    Yusuf said to his father: "O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!
    Qur'an 12:4

According to Ibn Kathir, Yaqub knew that Yusuf would someday become extremely important and would be in a high position, both in this world and the next — he recognized that the stars represented his brothers and the sun and moon represented himself and Yusuf's mother, Rachel. Yaqub advised Yusuf to keep the dream to himself in order to protect him from the jealousy of his brothers, who were already unhappy about the love Yaqub felt for Yusuf. Ya'qub foresaw that Yusuf would be one through whom the prophecy of his grandfather, Ibrahim (Abraham), would be fulfilled, in that his offspring would keep the light of Ibrahim's house alive and spread God's message to mankind. Abu Ya'ala interpreted Yaqub's reaction as an understanding that the planets, sun and moon bowing to Yusuf representing "something dispersed which God united."

    Ya'qub told Yusuf: "My son, relate not thy vision to thy brothers, lest they concoct a plot against thee: for Satan is a clear enemy to humanity. Thus your Lord has selected you and given you knowledge to interpret reports, and has perfected his blessing upon you and upon the family of Yaqub just as he perfected it on your forefathers before: Ibrahim and Is-haq (Isaac). Your Lord is Knowing, Wise" 
    Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 5-6

Yusuf did not tell his brothers his dream, unlike in the version relayed in the Hebrew Bible, but their dislike of him was already too strong to subdue. Ṭabari demonstrates this by adding that they said to each other, "verily Yusuf and his brother (Benjamin) are dearer to our father than we are, though we may be a troop ('usbah). By usbah they meant a group, for they were ten in number. They said, "Our father is plainly in a state of aberration.

Yusuf was known, in addition for being very handsome, to be of gentle temperament. He was respectful, kind and considerate. His brother Benjamin was equally pleasant and both were from the same mother, Rachel. From a hadith (Arabic: حديث, 'narration'):

Narrated Abu Huraira 🐈:
> Some people asked the Prophet ﷺ  : "Who is the most honorable amongst the people?" He replied, "The most honorable among them is the one who is the most Allah-fearing." They said, "O Prophet of Allah! We do not ask about this." He said, "Then the most honorable person is Yusuf, Nabiyyullah (Arabic: نبي الله, Prophet of Allah), the son of a Nabiyyillah, the son of a Nabiyyillah, the son of Khalilillah (Arabic: خليل الله, "Friend of Allah")."
> — Sahih al-Bukhari collected by Muhammad al-Bukhari

### Plot against Yusuf

The Qurʾān continues with Yusuf's brothers plotting to kill him. It relates: "in Yusuf and his brothers are signs for those who seek answers. When Yusuf's brother said about him: "He is more loved by our father than we are, and we are a group. Our father is in clear error. Let us kill Yusuf or cast him to the ground, so that the face of your father will be toward you, and after him you will be a community of the truthful."

But one of the brothers argued against killing him and suggested they throw him into a well, said to be Jubb Yusif ( جب يوسف, "Well of Yusuf"), so that a caravan might pick him up and take him into slavery. Mujahid, a scholar, says that it was Simeon and Suddi says it was Judah while Qatadah and Ibn Is-haq says that it was the eldest, Ruben. Said one of them: "Slay not Yusuf, but if ye must do something, throw him down to the bottom of the well: he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers."

Killing Yusuf because of jealousy would have been extreme, but scholars also suggested that Yusuf was fairly young when he was thrown into the well, as young as twelve. He would live to be 110 or 120.

The brothers asked their father to let them take Yusuf out to the desert to play and promised to watch him. Yaqub, not thrilled with the idea knowing how much the brothers disliked Yusuf, hesitated. Ṭabari comments that Yaqubs's excuse was that a dhi'b (Arabic: ذئب, wolf) might hurt him. But the brothers insisted. When they had Yusuf alone they threw him into a well and left him there, They returned with a blood stained shirt and lied that he had been attacked by a wolf, but their father did not believe them, as he was a sincere man who loved his son.

The Qur'an says:

    They said: "O our father! why dost thou not trust us with Yusuf, -- seeing we are indeed his sincere well-wishers?
    Send him with us tomorrow to enjoy himself and play, and we shall take every care of him."

    (Yaqub) said: "Really it saddens me that ye should take him away: I fear lest the wolf should devour him while ye attend not to him."
    They said: "If the wolf were to devour him while we are (so large) a party, then should we indeed (first) have perished ourselves!"
    
    So they did take him away, and they all agreed to throw him down to the bottom of the well: and We put into his heart (this Message): "Of a surety thou shalt (one day) tell them the truth of this their affair while they know (thee) not"

    Then they came to their father in the early part of the night, weeping.
    They said: "O our father! We went racing with one another, and left Yusuf with our things; and the wolf devoured him.... But thou wilt never believe us even if we tell the truth."

    They stained his shirt with false blood. He said: "Nay, but your minds have made up a tale (that may pass) with you, (for me) patience is most fitting: Against that which ye assert, it is Allah (alone) Whose help can be sought"...
    Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 11-18

Ṭabari comments that Judah stopped the brothers from causing more harm to Yusuf, and that he would bring him food. Ibn Kathir comments that Reuben suggested that they put him in the pit so that he might return later to bring him home. But when he returned, he found Yusuf gone. "So he screamed and tore his clothes. He put blood on the coat of Yusuf. When Yaqub learned of this, he tore his clothes, wore a black cloak, and was sad for many days. 

### God's plan to save Yusuf

A passing caravan took Yusuf. They had stopped by the well hoping to draw water to quench their thirst and saw the boy inside. So they retrieved him and sold him into slavery in Misr (مصر, Egypt), to a rich man referred to as "Al-'Aziz" ( ٱلعزيز, "Great One", "Nobleman") in the Qur'an, or Potiphar in the Bible. ʿAzīz is also known as Qatafir or Qittin. Yusuf was taken into 'Aziz's home who told his wife to treat him well.

    Then there came a caravan of travellers: they sent their water-carrier (for water), and he let down his bucket (into the well)...He said: "Ah there! Good news! Here is a (fine) young man!" So they concealed him as a treasure. But Allah knoweth well all that they do.

    The (Brethren) sold him for a miserable price, for a few dirhams counted out: in such low estimation did they hold him!
    
    The man in Egypt who bought him, said to his wife: "Make his stay (among us) honourable: maybe he will bring us much good, or we shall adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Yusuf in the land, that We might teach him the interpretation of stories (and events). And Allah hath full power and control over His affairs; but most among mankind know it not.

    When Yusuf attained His full manhood, We gave him power and knowledge: thus do We reward those who do right.
    Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 19-22

This is the point of the story that many scholars of Islam report as being central (contrasting to other religious traditions) to Yusuf's story. Under ʿAzīz Misr (عزيز مصر, "The Dear One of Egypt"), Yusuf moves to a high position in his household. Later, the brothers would come to Egypt but would not recognize Yusuf but called him by the same title, "al-ʿAzīz."

While working for 'Aziz, Yusuf grew to be a man. He was constantly approached by the wife of 'Aziz (Imra'at al-'Aziz, presumably Zulayka or Zuleika) who intended to seduce him. Tabari and others are not reticent to point out that Yusuf was mutually attracted to her. Ṭabari, again, says "God turned him away from his desire for evil by giving him a sign that he should not do it." It is also said that after the death of ʿAzīz, Yusuf married Zolayḵā.

    But she in whose house he was, sought to seduce him from his (true) self: she fastened the doors, and said: "Now come, thou (dear one)!" He said: "Allah forbid! truly (thy husband) is my lord! he made my sojourn agreeable! truly to no good come those who do wrong!"

    And (with passion) did she desire him, and he would have desired her, but that he saw the evidence of his Lord: thus (did We order) that We might turn away from him (all) evil and shameful deeds: for he was one of Our servants, sincere and purified.
    Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf) Ayat 23-24

Zolayḵā is said to have then ripped the back of Yusuf's shirt and they raced with one another to the door where her husband was waiting. At that point she attempted to blame Yusuf and suggested that he had attacked her. However, Yusuf said that it was Zolayḵā who had attempted to seduce him and his account is confirmed by one of the household. 'ʿAzīz believed Yusuf and told his wife to beg forgiveness." One member of the family, it is disputed who (perhaps a cousin) told ʿAzīz to check the shirt. If it was torn in the front than Yusuf was guilty and his wife innocent but if it was torn in the back, Yusuf was innocent and his wife guilty. It was torn in the back so ʿAzīz reprimands his wife for lying.

Zuleikha's circle of friends thought that she was becoming infatuated with Yusuf and mocked her for being in love with a slave. She invited them to her home and gave them all apples, and knives to peel them with. She then had Yusuf walk through and distract the women who cut themselves with the knives. Zuleikha then pointed out that she had to see Yusuf every day.

Yusuf prayed to God and said that he would prefer prison to the things that Zolayḵā and her friends wanted. According to Ṭabari, some time later, even though ʿAzīz knew that Yusuf was innocent, he "grew disgusted with himself for having let Yusuf go free … It seemed good to them to imprison him for a time." It is possible that Zolayḵā had influence here, rebuking her husband for having her honor threatened.

The account of Yusuf and the wife of 'Aziz is called "Yusuf and Zulaikha," and has been told and retold countless times in many languages. The Qur'anic account differs from the Biblical version in which Potiphar believes his wife and throws Yusuf into prison.

### Yusuf interprets dreams

This account refers to the interaction between Yusuf and the ruler of Egypt. Unlike the references to the Pharaoh in the account of Musa, the account of Yusuf refers to the Egyptian ruler as a malik (ملك, 'king'), not a fir'aun (فرعون, 'pharaoh'). After Yusuf had been imprisoned for a few years, God granted him the ability to interpret dreams, a power that made him popular amongst the prisoners. One event concerns two royal servants who, prior to Yusuf's imprisonment, had been thrown into the dungeon for attempting to poison the food of the king – whose name is not given either in the Qur'an or the Bible – and his family. Yusuf asked them about the dreams they had, and one of them described that he saw himself pressing grapes into wine. The other said he had seen himself holding a basket of bread on his head and birds were eating from it. Yusuf reminded the prisoners that his ability to interpret dreams was a favor from God based on his adherence to monotheism. Yusuf then stated that one of the men (the one who dreamt of squeezing grapes for wine) would be released from the prison and serve the king, but warned that the other would be executed, and so was done in time.

Yusuf had asked the one whom he knew would be released (Ṭabari writes that his name was Nabu) to mention his case to the king. When asked about his time in prison, Ṭabari reports that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   said: "If Yusuf had not said that—meaning what he said (to Nabu)—he would not have stayed in prison as long as he did because he sought deliverance from someone other than God."

The king had a dream of seven fat cows 🐄 being eaten by seven skinny ones and seven ears of corn being replaced with shriveled ones, and he was terrified. None of his advisors could interpret it. When the servant who was released from prison heard about it, he remembered Yusuf from prison and persuaded the king to send him to Yusuf so that he could return with an interpretation. Yusuf told the servant that Egypt would face seven years of prosperity and then suffer seven years of famine and that the king should prepare for it so as to avoid great suffering.

Scholars debate as to whether Yusuf agreed to interpret the dream right away or if he declared that his name should be cleared in the house of ʿAzīz first. Ṭabari notes that when the messenger came to Yusuf and invited him to come to the king, Yusuf replied "Go back to your lord and ask him about the case of the women who cut their hands. My lord surely knows their guile." Ibn Kathir agrees with Ṭabari saying that Yusuf sought "restitution for this in order that ʿAzīz might know that he was not false to him during his absence" and that Zolayḵā eventually confessed that nothing happened between them. Ṭabari inserts an interesting interaction between Yusuf and the angel Gabriel in which Gabriel helps Yusuf both gain his freedom and admit to his own desires.

Yusuf was brought to king and interpreted the dream.

    Yusuf said, "What you cultivate during the next seven years, when the time of harvest comes, leave the grains in their spikes, except for what you eat. After that, seven years of drought will come, which will consume most of what you stored for them. After that, a year will come that brings relief for the people, and they will, once again, press juice." 
    Qur'an, 12:47-49 

    When he became aware of Yusuf's innocence, the king said, "Bring him to me that I may attach him to my person." Then, when he spoke to him, he said: "Verily, this day, you are with us high in rank and fully trusted." 
    Quran 12:54 

Upon speaking with Yusuf, the king recognized his virtues, great ability, brilliance, good conduct and perfect mannerisms. 

    Yusuf said, "Set me over the storehouses of the land; I will indeed guard them with full knowledge" 
    Quran 12:55

Thus Yusuf asked the king to appoint him as Minister of Finance.

### Use of "king" versus "pharaoh"

In the Qur'an, the title of the Ruler of Egypt during the time of Yusuf is specifically said to be "the King" (Arabic: al-Malik) whilst the Ruler of Egypt during the time of Moses is specifically said to be "Pharaoh" (Arabic: Firaun, though as a name without the definite article). This is interesting because according to historical sources, the title Pharaoh only began to be used to refer to the rulers of Egypt (starting with the rule of Thutmose III) in 1479 BCE - approximately 21 years after the prophet Yusuf died. But in the narration of Yusuf in the Bible, the titles King (Hebrew: Melekh) and Pharaoh are used interchangeably for the ruler of Egypt in Genesis chapters 39-41.

This proves that the Quran is accurate and fixes error that were incorporated into the Bible by various sources.

    The Malik (of Egypt) said: "I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn, and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! expound to me my vision, if it be that ye can interpret visions."
    Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf), Ayah 43
    
    Then after them We sent Musa with Our Signs to Fir'aun and his chiefs, but they wrongfully rejected them. So see how was the end of al-Mufsidin (Arabic: ألمفسدين, "the Mischief-makers" or "the Corrupters").
    Qur'an, Surah 7 (Al-Araf), Ayah 103 
    
    And the Malik said: "Bring him to me." But when the messenger came to him, He (Yusuf) said: "Return to your lord and ask him, 'What happened to the women who cut their hands? Surely, my Lord (Allah) is Well-Aware of their plot.
    Qur'an, Surah 12 (Yusuf), Ayah 50
    
> And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were bound; and he was there in the prison.
> Genesis 39:20
   
> And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
> Genesis 41:46
  
> And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
> Genesis 47:11

### The Family Reunion

Yusuf became extremely powerful. Ibn Kathir relates that the king of Egypt had faith in Yusuf and that the people loved and revered him. It is said that Yusuf was 30 when he was summoned to the king. "The king addressed him in 70 languages, and each time Yusuf answered him in that language." Ibn Is-haq comments, "the king of Egypt converted to Islam at the hands of Yusuf."

Yusuf's brothers, in the meantime, had suffered while the people of Egypt prospered under Yusuf's guidance. Yaqub and his family were hungry and the brothers went to Egypt, unaware that Yusuf was there and in such a high position. Yusuf gave them what they needed but questions them and they reveal that there were once twelve of them. They lie and say that the one most loved by their father, meaning Yusuf, died in the desert. Yusuf tells them to bring Benjamin, the youngest, to him. They return home to Yaqub and persuade him to let Benjamin accompany them in order to secure food. Yaqub insists that they bring Benjamin back—and this time the brothers are honest when they swear to it. According to Ibn Kathir, Yaqub ordered the brothers to use many gates when returning to Egypt because they were all handsome. The Qurʾān itself elaborates that Yaqub sensed Yusuf.

When the brothers return with Benjamin, Yusuf reveals himself to Benjamin. He then gives the brothers the supplies he promised but also put the king's cup into one of the bags. He then proceeds to accuse them of stealing, which the brothers deny. Yusuf informs them that whoever it was who stole the cup will be enslaved to the owner and the brothers agree, not realizing the plot against them. Ṭabari reports that the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

After much discussion and anger, the brothers try to get Benjamin released by offering themselves instead — for they must keep their promise to their father. Reuben stays behind with Benjamin in order to keep his promise to his father. When the other brothers inform Yaqub of what has happened, Yaqub does not believe them and becomes blind after crying much over the disappearance of his son. Forty years had passed since Yusuf was taken from his father, and Yaqub had held it in his heart. Yaqub sends the brothers back to find out about Benjamin and Yusuf. Upon their return Yusuf reveals himself to his brothers and gives them one of his shirts to give to Yaqub.

When Yaqub receives the shirt, this time as good news, Yaqub lays it on his face and regains his vision. He says `Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know?` (12:96). Ṭabari says that this means that "from the truth of the interpretation of Yusuf's dream in which he saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon bowing down to him, he knew that which they did not know."

Yusuf was reunited with his family, and his dream as a child came true as he saw his parents and eleven of his brothers prostrating before him in love, welcome and respect. Ibn Kathir mentions that his mother had already died. Ṭabari says that she was alive. Yusuf eventually died in Egypt.

It is hard to find sources that consistently agree on the actual dates of Yusuf's life. Scholars tend to see the story as a way for the descendants of Ibrahim to find their way to Egypt. Yusuf is the reason the Israelites move to Egypt, which then allows for the story of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt to take place.

</details><details><summary>

## Ayyub -- Job

</summary>

Ayyub (Job) came after Yusuf. The Quran describes Ayyub as a righteous servant of Allah, who was afflicted by suffering for a lengthy period of time. However, it clearly states that Ayyub never lost faith in God and forever called to God in prayer.

Ibn Ishâq said that the Prophet Ayyub (Job) was Roman. His lineage was Ayyub Ibn Moos Ibn Razih Ibn ‛Ees ibn Ishaq Ibn Ibraheem (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon them all).

However, others said that his lineage was Ayyub ibn Moos ibn Ra‛ooeel ibn ‛Ees ibn Ishâq ibn Ya’qoob (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon them all).

Ibn Asakir reported that his mother was the daughter of Loot (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him). It is said that his father was among those who believed in Ibraheem (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) on the day he was thrown in the fire and was to be burnt but survived.
However, of all these opinions, the first opinion is the most popular because he was from the progeny of Ibraheem (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him). This is seen in the saying of Allah:

    "… and from his offspring Dawood, Sulaymân, Ayyub, Yusuf, Moosa and Hâroon…" 
    Qur’an 6:84

In this verse, the pronoun ‘his’ is referring to Ibraheem and not Nooh (peace be upon them all).

He is one of those Prophets who are mentioned specially that they received revelations. This is seen in Soorah an-Nisâ :

    "Indeed We have revealed to you as We revealed to Nooh and the Prophets after him. And We revealed to Ibraheem, Isma’eel, Ishâq, Ya’qoob, the tribes, ‘Eesa and Ayyub…" 
    Qur’an 4:163

So the correct opinion is that he is from the progeny of ‛Ees Ibn Ishaq Ibn Ibraheem (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon them all). As regards his wife's name, it is said she was Leea bint Ya‛qoob (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him). Some others say that her name was Rahmah bint Ifratheem. Yet some others claim that she was Leea bint Mansa Ibn Ya‛qoob (may the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him). This is the most popular opinion, and we have mentioned it here.

Allah said: "And Ayyub, when he called to his Lord, saying ‘Harm has inflicted me and You are the Most Merciful.' So We answered him and removed his affliction and We gave him his family and the like of them with them, as a mercy from Us and a reminder to Worshippers.'". (Qur’an 21:83-84)

And in Soorah Sâd:

    And mention Our slave Ayyub when he called his Lord, "The Shaytân has afflicted me with distress and torment." 
    
    [Allah said], "Strike with your foot, this is [a spring of] water to wash in, cool and a [refreshing] drink." 
    
    And We gave him his family and the like of thereof, as a mercy from Us and a reminder to those who understand. 

    "And take in your hand a bundle of thin grass and strike therewith and do not break your oath." Truly, We found him patient. How excellent a slave. Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance." 
    Qur’an 38:41-44

Qur’anic exegetes, historians and others said that Ayyub (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was a wealthy man who owned all kinds of wealth, such as cattle, sheep and servants, and vast property in a place called Hoorân. He also had many children and large family.

Then all of this was taken away from him. His body was inflicted with different kinds of diseases to such an extent that there was no part of his body that was healthy except his heart and tongue with which he remembered Allah. All throughout this, he remained patient and remembered Allah all the time, during the night and day, and in the morning and the evening.

His illnesses prolonged for such a long time that even his friends deserted him and his relatives stayed away from him. He was expelled from his town and thrown upon a dunghill. Everybody left him except his wife who fulfilled her duties. She did this because of the many good times she had with him and due to her compassion for him. She used to come to him and help him out in his necessities. It came to such an extent that she became weak and her money almost finished. She was in such a difficult situation that she started working to earn wages in order to provide for her husband. May Allah be pleased with her. She remained patient with him even through hard times that hit them when they were inflicted with loss of money, children and her husband became very ill.

It is established in an authentic hadith that the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him said:
> "The most severely tried among the people are the Prophets. Then after them the righteous and then the likes and so on."

And said: 

> "And man is put to trial according to the strength of his religion thus if his religion was strong, his trial increased." 
> Ahmad, vol 1, p. 172

Mujahid is reported to have said that the Prophet Ayyub (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was the first to be inflicted by smallpox.
Historians and scholars differed as regards the period of time he was inflicted with trials. Wahb ibn Munâbbih said that he suffered for three years, not more not less. Anas on the other hand said that he suffered for about seven years and a few months. Humayd said that the period was eighteen years. The severity of the disease has been described by as-Suddi that it was so severe, that his flesh dropped from his body and nothing remained on him except his bones and muscles. His wife used to bring ashes and spread it under his body. When the trial went for long, she said, "O' Ayyub, if you pray to your Lord, He will free you from this suffering." He answered, "I have lived for seventy years as a healthy person, so can I not be patient for Allah for another seventy years?" she worked for people to earn money in order to feed Ayyub (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) (Tafseer at-Tabari, vol 23 p.107)

However, the people then started to be cautious of her and did not employ her because they knew that she was the wife of Ayyub (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and because of that, they too might get infected by the same illnesses or be put to the same trial. So when she did not find anybody to give work, she went to some of the daughters of high society and sold one of her plait in return for plenty of food. When she came to Ayyub (may the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) with food, he asked her where did she get the food from. He showed his disapproval but she said, "I worked for the people.” Then when it was the following day and again she did not find anyone who gave her work, she sold the other plait in return for food. She then brought it to Ayyub (peace be upon him). This time Ayyub (peace be upon him) swore that he would not eat the food till she tells him from where she has got it. At that, she removed her headscarf. When Ayyub (peace be upon him) saw her head has been shaved, he supplicated to Allah:

    And Ayyub when he called his Lord [saying], "Harm has inflicted me and You are the Most Merciful."
    Qur’an 21:83

Ibn Abi Hâtim reported on the authority of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Ubayd ibn Umayr who said: “Ayyub had two brother. One day, they came to him but they could not go near him because of the bad smell which came from his body. So they stood at a distance and one of them said to another, ‘If Allah knew any good in Ayyub, He would not have put him to this trial.’ This grieved Ayyub (peace be upon him) so much that he never got such grief before. He supplicated, ‘O’ Allah, if You know that I never spent a night with a full stomach if I knew someone hungry in that night, then prove me true.’ So he was proved true and a voice came from the heaven confirming his truth that was heard by the two brothers. He then supplicated further, ‘O’ Allah, if You know that I never had two shirts if I knew that someone did not have clothes, then prove me true.’ Again, he was proved true from the heavens while the brothers were listening. Finally, he supplicated, ‘O’ Allah, I seek help from Your Honour.’ When saying that, he fell down in prostration and said, ‘O’ Allah, by Your Honour, I will never lift my head till You cure me from my suffering.’ Then he did not lift his head till he was cured.”

Ibn Abi Hâtim reported on the authority of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abbâs who said: “ Allah dressed Ayyub (peace be upon him) with a dress from Paradise, then he went aside and sat in a corner. His wife came and did not recognise him. So she asked, ‘O’ slave of Allah, where did the afflicted person go who was here? I am afraid that dogs or wolves have eaten him.’ She kept speaking to him for some time and then he finally said to her, ‘What is wrong with you, I am Ayyub, Allah has indeed returned to me my body.’”

Ibn Abbâs said: “Allah returned to him his wealth and children and others twice as many as them.”

Ibn Abi Hâtim reported that Wahb ibn Munabbih said: “Allah revealed to him, ‘I returned to you your family and your wealth, and the like of them along with them. So take a bath from this water, for there is a cure for you in it and offer sacrifice on behalf of your companions and seek forgiveness for them for verily they disobeyed Me concerning you.’”

It is narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him said:

> When Allah cured Ayyub He rained on him golden locusts. Ayyub began collecting them with his hands and putting them in his clothes. It was said to him, ‘O’ Ayyub, are you not satisfied and full?’ He said, ‘O’ Lord, who will feel full from Your Mercy?’"

In another narration on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him said:

>"While Ayyub was bathing naked, golden locusts dropped on him, so he began collecting them in his clothes. So his Lord called him, ‘O’ Ayyub, did I not give you enough, so what do you do?’ Ayyub said, ‘Yes my Lord but there is no sparing from Your blessings for me.’ "Strike with your foot" was the divine order. So Ayyub (peace be upon him) did as ordained and struck the earth with his leg. Allah then caused a cold spring of water to gush forth and ordered him to take bath and drink from it. Allah then removed his suffering and pain, his illnesses and diseases that were both visible and hidden on his body and replaced all that with a healthy body, both visible and hidden. Allah also made him handsome and gave him abundant wealth, to the extent that golden locusts rained on him.

Allah also returned his family as He said,  `We gave to him his family, and the like of them with them.` (Qur’an 21:84) It is said that Allah brought his children back to life. Some others said that Allah gave him other people in place of those who had died, wherein in the Hereafter, Allah will gather them all together. As regards the part of the verse, `A mercy from Us,` (Qur’an 21:83-84) it means that We removed his hardships and cured him from whatever he had as a mercy and grace from Us. The end of the verse, “And a reminder to worshippers” means that what happened to Ayyub (peace be upon him) is a reminder and a lesson for all those who are put to trial concerning their bodies, wealth, and family. All such people should take the example of Prophet of Allah, Ayyub, who was tried by Allah with something that was greater than what others would be inflicted with and despite that, he was patient and had hope that Allah would cure him from that.

Ayyub (peace be upon him) lived in the Roman land for a further seventy years after his affliction. He preached to them the religion of Monotheism, One God. However, they later changed the religion of Ibraheem (peace be upon him) after his death.

Allah said: `“And take in your hand a bundle of reeds and strike with it, and do not break your oath. And We found him patient, a good slave, verily he was patient. (Qur’an 38:44)`

This speaks about His mercy upon Ayyub (peace be upon him) when Ayyub had sworn that he would whip his wife one hundred lashes. It is said that he made the oath because she sold her plaits. It is also said that Shaytân came to her disguised as a doctor (physician) and described to her some medicines for Ayyub. When she came and informed Ayyub, he knew it was Shaytân and subsequently swore that he would whip her one hundred lashes. When Allah cured him, He told him to take a bundle of reeds, bunch them together as one and then to hit her only once. This one hit was considered one hundred, thus he could fulfill his oath this way.

This was a way out and relief for the one who feared Allah and obeyed Him, especially with respect to his wife who bore his illness patiently and had hope. She was a pious, righteous ans rightly guided woman. May Allah be pleased with her.

Ibn Jareer and others mentioned that when Ayyub (peace be upon him) died, he was ninety-three years old. Some others said that he lived longer than that.
Before he passed away, he entrusted his mission to his son Hawmal and after him to his other son Bishr. Many people claim that he was Dhul Kifl. And Allah knows best. These same people also claim that he was Prophet, who died at the age of ninety-five.

    And [mention] Ayyub, when he called to his Lord, "Indeed, adversity has touched me, and you are the Most Merciful of the merciful." 
    Quran, sura 21 (The Prophets), ayah 83

## Shuayb

</summary>

Shuaib, Shoaib, Shuayb or Shuʿayb (شعيب,  meaning: "who shows the right path") is an ancient Midianite Nabi (Prophet) in Islam. Shuaib is mentioned in the Quran a total of 11 times. He is believed to have lived after Ibrahim (Abraham), and Muslims believe that he was sent as a prophet to a community: the Midianites, who are also known as the Aṣḥāb al-Aykah ("Companions of the Wood"), since they used to worship a large tree. To the people, Shuaib proclaimed the straight path and warned the people to end their fraudulent ways. When the community did not repent, God destroyed the community.

Shuaib is understood by Muslims to have been one of the few Arabian prophets mentioned by name in the Qur'an, the others being Saleh, Hud, and Muhammad. It is said that he was known by Muslims as "the eloquent preacher amongst the prophets", because he was, according to tradition, granted talent and eloquence in his language.

The Qur'an states that Shuaib was appointed by God to be a prophet to the people of Midian. The people of this land were said to be especially notorious for cheating others through dishonesty and for idolatry. Shuʿayb's prophecy mainly involved calling the Midianites to the correct path of God, and forbidding them to worship false gods.

It is also said he told his people to stop being dishonest in their daily activities. Although he preached and prophesied for a sustained period of time, the majority of the people refused to listen to him. Shuayb, however, remained steadfast. He consistently preached powerfully against the wicked, telling them of the punishment that had befallen the sinful before them. Shuʿayb warned the people that their ignorance would lead to the destruction of Midian, giving historical examples of earlier prophets, including Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot, all of whose people had been destroyed by God.

The people taunted Shuʿayb and told him that, were it not for the prestigious family he came from, he would surely have been stoned to death. Shuayb replied, "Is my family of more consideration with you than God?" When the Midianites refused to believe, they were destroyed by a mighty earthquake. The Qur'an, however, mentions that Shuʿayb, and his believing companions, were rescued from the thunderous punishment.

The area to which Shuʿayb was sent to is named 'Madyan in the Qur'an, known in English as Midian, which is frequently referred to in the Bible. The Midianites were said to be of Arab descent, though being neighbors of the Biblical Canaanites, they intermixed with them. It is said they were a wandering tribe, and that their principal territory at the time of Musa (Moses) was the Sinai Peninsula.

Shuayb's mission is often mentioned in the Qur'an with the mission of Noah, Hud, Saleh and Lot. Scholars have pointed out that these five prophets exemplify the early prophetic missions: The prophet would be sent to his community; the community would pay no attention to his warning and would instead threaten him with punishment; after years of preaching, God would ask him to leave his community, while his people were subsequently destroyed in a punishment. Scholars chronologically interpret the listing of the five prophets, so Shuʿayb was a descendant of Noah (preached about the Great Flood) and the Prophet Abraham.

### Disputed identification with Jethro

Jethro is mentioned in the Bible (Exodus 3:1) as the father in law of Moses. Although Shuaib is frequently identified with the Midianite priest Jethro, most modern scholars reject this identification. Classical commentators, such as Ibn Kathir, say Shuʿayb was a great-grandson of Abraham: Shuʿayb is believed to have been the son of Mikil, son of Issachar, son of Midian, son of Abraham. That would render impossible the identification with Jethro, who lived at the time of Moses, purportedly hundreds of years after Abraham.

# 5. Musa and the Exodus
*******************************************

> ~ 1500 BCE

<details><summary>

## Musa -- Moses 🌿🔥

</summary>

In Islam, Mūsā ben ʿEmrān (Arabic: موسی بن عمران, lit. 'Moses, son of Imran'Amram'Am), is an important prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and is the most frequently mentioned individual in the Quran, with his name being mentioned 136 times and his life being narrated and recounted more than that of any other prophet.

According to Islamic theology, all Muslims must have faith in every prophet and messenger of God, which includes Musa and his brother Harun. The tale of Musa is generally seen as a spiritual parallel to the life of prophet Muhammadﷺ  , and Muslims consider many aspects of the two individuals' lives to be shared. Islamic literature also describes a parallel relation between their people and the incidents that occurred in their lifetimes; the exodus of the Israelites from ancient Egypt is considered to be similar in nature to the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina as both events unfolded in the face of persecution — of the Israelites by the ancient Egyptians, and of the early Muslims by the Meccans, respectively.

Musa is also viewed as a very important figure in Islam due to his reception of revelations such as the Ten Commandments, which form part of the contents of the Torah and are central to the Abrahamic religions of Judaism and Christianity. Consequently, Jews and Christians are designated as "People of the Book" for Muslims and are to be recognized with this special status wherever Islamic law is applied. According to Islamic tradition, Musa is one of the many prophets that meets Muhammad in the seven heavens following the latter's ascension from Jerusalem during the Miʿraj. During the journey, Musa is said to have repeatedly sent Muhammad back to meet God and request a reduction in the number of required daily prayers—originally 50—until only the five obligatory prayers remained. Musa is further revered in Islamic literature, which expands upon the incidents of his life and the miracles attributed to him in the Quran and hadith, such as his direct conversations with God.

    Verily, We did send down the Torah to Moses therein was guidance and light, by which the Prophets, who submitted themselves to God’s Will, judged the Jews.  And the rabbis and the priests too judged the Jews by the Torah for to them was entrusted the protection of God’s Book, and they were witnesses thereto.
    Quran, 5:44

The period of Joseph and Jacob/Israel in Egypt (Genesis 39:50), where they were in favour at the Egyptian court and Joseph held high administrative positions next to the ruler of the land, would correspond to the time the Hyksos ruled in Egypt, during the Fifteenth Dynasty. The time of Moses and the expulsion to Palestine related in The Exodus could also correspond to the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt.

## Musa in a basket on the Nile

</summary>
  
### Childhood

According to Islamic tradition, Musa was born into a family of Israelites living in Egypt. Of his family, Islamic tradition generally names his father 'Imran, corresponding to the Amram of the Hebrew Bible, traditional genealogies name Levi as his ancestor. Islam states that Musa was born in a time when the ruling Pharaoh had enslaved the Israelites after the time of the prophet Yusuf (Yusuf). Islamic literature states that around the time of Musa's birth, the Pharaoh has a dream in which he sees fire coming from the city of Jerusalem, which burns everything in his kingdom except in the land of the Israelites. (Other stories says that the Pharaoh dreams of a little boy who catches the Pharaoh's crown and destroys it, although there is no authentic Islamic reference to whether the dreams actually occurred.) When the Pharaoh is informed that one of the male children would grow up to overthrow him, he orders the killing of all newborn Israelite males in order to prevent the prediction from occurring. Experts of economics in Pharaoh's court advise him that killing the male infants of the Israelites would result in loss of manpower. Therefore, they suggest that male infants should be killed in one year but spared the next. Musa's brother, Harun, was born in the year when infants were spared, while Musa was born in the year when infants were to be killed.

    "We recite to you some of the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth, for a people who believe. Verily, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people sects, weakening (oppressing) a group (i.e. Children of Israel) among them; killing their sons and letting their females live.  Verily, he was of those who commit great sins and crimes, oppressors, tyrant."
    Quran, 28:3-4

### On the Nile

According to Islamic tradition, Jochebed, Musa's mother, suckles him secretly during this period. When they are in danger of being caught, God inspires her to put him in a wicker basket and set him adrift on the Nile. She instructs her daughter to follow the course of the ark and report back to her. 

    So We sent this inspiration to the mother of Moses: "Suckle (thy child) but when thou hast fears about him cast him, into the river, but fear not nor grieve: for We shall restore him to thee, and We shall make him one of Our messengers."
    Quran, 28:7

As her daughter follows the ark along the riverbank, Musa is discovered by the Pharaoh's wife, Asiya, who convinces the Pharaoh to adopt him. When Asiya ordered wet nurses for Musa, Musa refuses to be breastfed. Islamic tradition states that this is because God forbids Musa from being fed by any wet nurse in order to reunite him with his mother. His sister worries that Musa has not been fed for some time, so she appears to the Pharaoh and informs him that she knows someone who can feed him. After being questioned, she is ordered to bring the woman being discussed. The sister brings their mother, who feeds Musa, and thereafter, she is appointed as the wet nurse of Musa.

    Then the household of Pharaoh picked him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a (cause of) grief Verily! Pharaoh, Haman and their hosts were sinners. And the wife of Pharaoh said: "A comfort of the eye for me and for you. Kill him not, perhaps he may be of benefit to us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they perceived not (the result of that). 
    Quran Ayah 28:9

## Escape to Midian

</summary>
  
After having reached adulthood, according to the Quran, Musa is passing through a city when he comes across an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite. The Israelite man is believed to be Sam'ana, known in the Bible to be a Samaritan, who asks Musa for his assistance against the Egyptian who is mistreating him. Musa attempts to intervene and becomes involved in the dispute. Musa strikes the Egyptian in a state of anger, which results in his death. Musa then repents to God.

    He said: "My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself, so forgive me." Then He forgave him. Verily, He is the Forgiving, the Most Merciful.

And the following day, he again comes across the same Israelite fighting with another Egyptian. The Israelite again asks Musa for help, and as Musa approaches the Israelite, he reminds Musa of his manslaughter and asks if Musa intended to kill the Egyptian. 

Musa is reported, and the Pharaoh orders Musa to be killed. However, Musa flees to the desert after being alerted to his punishment. 

    So he escaped from there, looking about in a state of fear. He said: "My Lord! Save me from the people who are Zalimeen (polytheists and wrong-doers)!" 
    Quran Ayah 28:15-21

According to Islamic tradition, after Musa arrives in Midian, he witnesses two female shepherds driving back their flocks from a well. Musa approaches them and inquires about their work as shepherds and their retreat from the well. Upon hearing their answers and about the old age of their father, Musa waters their flocks for them.

    And when he arrived at the water of Midian (Midyan) he found there a group of men watering (their flocks), and besides them he found two women who were keeping back (their flocks). He said: "What is the matter with you ?" They said: "We cannot water (our flocks) until the shepherds take (their flocks). And our father is a very old man."

    So he watered their flocks for them, then he turned back to shade, and said: "My Lord! Truly, I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me!" 
    Quran Ayah 28:22-24

The two shepherds return to their home and inform their father of Musa. They then invite Musa to a feast. At that feast, their father asks Musa to work for him for a period of eight years in return for marriage to one of his daughters. Musa consents and works for him for ten years.

#### Ten Years of Preparation
Time passed, and he lived in seclusion far from his family and his people. This period of ten years was of importance in his life. It was a period of major preparation. Certainly Moses's mind was absorbed in the stars every night. He followed the sunrise and the sunset every day. He pondered on the plant and how it splits the soil and appears thereafter. He contemplated water and how the earth is revived by it and flourishes after its death.

Of course, he was immersed in the Glorious Book of Allah, open to the insight and heart. He was immersed in the existence of Allah. All these became latent within him. The religion of Moses was the same as that of Jacob , which was Islamic monotheism. His forefather was Jacob the grandson of Abraham . Moses , therefore, was one of the descendants of Abraham and every prophet who came after Abraham was one of Abraham's successors.

In addition to physical preparation, there was a similar spiritual preparation. It was made in complete seclusion, in the middle of the desert and in the places of pasture. Silence was his way of life, and seclusion was his vehicle. Allah the Almighty prepared for His prophet the tools he would need later on to righteously bear the commands of Allah the Exalted.

## Musa and Harun become prophets

</summary>

### Call to prophethood

    And when he attained his full strength, and was perfect (in manhood), We bestowed on him Hukman (Prophethood, right judgment of the affairs) and religious knowledge of the religion of his forefathers i.e., Islamic Monotheism. And thus do We reward the Muhsineen (i.e., good-doers). 
    Quran Ayah 28:14

According to the Quran, Musa departs for Egypt along with his family after completing the contracted time period (ten years). During their travel, as they stop near Tur, Musa observes a large fire and instructs the family to wait until he returns with fire 🔥 for them. 

    Almighty Allah narrated this event: And has there come to you the story of Moses? When he saw a fire, he said to his family: "Wait! Verily, I have seen a fire, perhaps I can bring you some burning brand therefrom, or find some guidance at the fire."

When Musa reaches the Valley of Tuwa, God calls out to him from the right side of the valley from a tree, on what is revered as Al-Buq‘ah Al-Mubārakah ("The Blessed Ground") in the Quran. 

    And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name: "0 Moses! Verily! I am your Lord! So take off your shoes, you are in the sacred valley, Tuwa, And I have chosen you. So listen to that which is inspired to you. Verily! I am Allah! La ilaha illa Ana (none has the right to be worshipped but I), so worship Me, and offer prayers perfectly, for My Remembrance. Verily, the Hour is coming - and My Will is to keep it hidden - that every person may be rewarded for that which he strives. Therefore, let the one who believes not therein (i.e. in the Day of Resurrection, Reckoning, Paradise and Hell, etc.), but follows his own lusts, divert you therefrom lest you perish. And what is that in your right hand, 0 Moses?"

    He said: "This is my stick, whereon I lean, and wherewith I beat down branches for my sheep, and wherein I find other uses."

    (Allah) said: "Cast it down, 0 Moses!"

    He cast it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving quickly.

    Allah said: "Grasp it, and fear not, We shall return it to its former state, - and press your (right) hand to your (left) side, it will come forth white (and shining), without any disease as another sign, - that We may show you (some) of Our Greater Signs.

    "Go to Pharoah! Verily, he has transgressed (all bounds in disbelief and disobedience, and has behaved as an arrogant, and as a tyrant)." 
    Surah 9-24

Musa is commanded by God to remove his shoes and is informed of his selection as a prophet, his obligation of prayer and the Day of Judgment. Musa is then ordered to throw his rod, which turns into a snake 🐍, and later instructed to hold it. The Quran then narrates Musa being ordered to insert his hand into his clothes and when he revealed it, it shines a bright light. God states that these are signs for the Pharaoh, and orders Musa to invite Pharaoh to the worship of one God. Musa expresses his fear of Pharaoh and requests God to heal his speech impediment and grant him Harun as a helper. 

    (Moses) said: "0 my Lord! Open for me my chest (grant me self-confidence, contentment, and boldness). And ease my task for me; and make loose the knot (the defect) from my tongue, (i.e. remove the incorrectness of my speech) that they understand my speech, and appoint for me a helper from my family, Aaron, my brother; increase my strength with him, and let him share my task (of conveying Allah's Message and Prophethood), that we may glorify You much, and remember You much, Verily! You are of us Ever a Well-Seer."
    
    Allah said: "You are granted your request, 0 Moses!

According to Islamic tradition, both of them state their fear of Pharaoh, but are assured by God that He would be observing them and commands them to inform the Pharaoh to free the Israelites. Therefore, they depart to preach to the Pharaoh.

    "And I have Istanatuka chosen you for My Inspiration and My Message for Myself Go you and your brother with My Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and do not, you both, slacken and become weak in My Remembrance.

    "Go, both of you, to Pharaoh, verily, he has transgressed (all bounds in disbelief and disobedience and behaved as an arrogant and as a tyrant). And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear Allah."

    They said. "Our Lord! Verily! We fear lest he should hasten to punish us or lest he should transgress (all bounds against us)."

    He (Allah) said. "Fear not, Verily! I am with you both, Hearing and Seeing. So go you both to him, and say: 'Verily, we are Messengers of your Lord, so let the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not; indeed, we have come with a sign from your Lord! And peace will be upon him who follows the guidance! Truly, it has been revealed to us that the torment will be for him who denies believes not in the Oneness of Allah, and in His Messengers, etc., and turns away' (from the truth and obedience of Allah)." 
    Quran Surah 20

The Quran states that Musa was sent by God to confront the erstwhile (pharaoh) of ancient Egypt and to guide the Israelites, who were enslaved by the former. The Quran directly validates Musa and Harun as prophets chosen by God:

    And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet. And We called him from the side of the mount at [his] right and brought him near, confiding [to him]. And We gave him out of Our mercy his brother Harun as a prophet.
    Quran 19:51–53

## Musa confronts pharaoh's sourcerers

</summary>
  
### Arrival at Pharaoh's court

When Musa and Harun arrive in the court of Pharaoh and proclaim their prophethood to the Pharaoh, the Pharaoh begins questioning Musa about the God he follows. The Quran narrates that Musa answers the Pharaoh by stating that he follows the God who gives everything its form and guides them. The Pharaoh then inquires about the generations who passed before them, and Musa answers that knowledge of the previous generations is with God. 

The Quran also mentions the Pharaoh questioning Musa: “And what is the Lord of the worlds?” Musa replies that God is the lord of the heavens, the earth and what is between them. The Pharaoh then reminds Musa of his childhood with them and the killing of the man he has done. Musa admits that he has committed the deed in ignorance, but insists that he is now forgiven and guided by God. Pharaoh accuses him of being mad and threatens to imprison him if he continues to proclaim that the Pharaoh is not the true god. Musa informs him that he has come with manifest signs from God. 

    Allah said. "Nay! Go you both with Our Signs. Verily! We shall be with you, listening. And when you both come to Pharaoh, say: 'We are the Messengers of the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists), - So allow the children of Israel to go with us.

    (Pharaoh) said (to Moses): "Did we not bring you up among us as a child? And you did dwell many years of you life with us. And you did your deed which you did (i.e. the crime of killing a man). And you are one of the ingrates."

    Moses said: "I did it then, when I was an ignorant (as regards my Lord and His Message). So I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord has granted me Hukman (i.e., religious knowledge, right judgments of the affairs and Prop het hood), and appointed me as one of the Messengers. And this is the past favor with which you reproach me, - that you have enslaved the children of Israel."

    Pharaoh said: "And what is the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)?"

    Moses replied: "Lord of the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them, if you seek to be convinced with certainty."

    Pharaoh said to those around: "Do you not hear (what he says)?"

    Moses said: "Your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers!"

    Pharaoh said: "Verily, your Messenger who has been sent to you is a madman!"

    Moses said: "Lord of the east and the west, and all that is between them, if you did but understand!"

    Pharaoh said: "If you choose an ilah (a god) other than me, I will certainly put you among the prisoners."

    Moses said: "Even if I bring you something manifest (and convincing)."

    Pharaoh said: "Bring it forth then, if you are of the truthful!" 
    Quran Surah 26:16-31

When the Pharaoh demands to see the signs, Musa throws his staff to the floor, and it turns into a serpent 🐍. He then draws out his hand, and it shines a bright white light. The Pharaoh's counselors advises him that this is sorcery, and on their advice he summons the best sorcerers in the kingdom. The Pharaoh challenges Musa to a battle between him and the Pharaoh's magicians, asking him to choose the day. Musa chose the day of a festival.

### Confrontation with sorcerers

When the sorcerers come to the Pharaoh, he promises them that they would be among the honored among his assembly if they won. On the day of the festival of Egypt, Musa grants the sorcerers the chance to perform first and warned them that God would expose their tricks. The Quran states that the sorcerers bewitch the eyes of the observers and cause them terror. The summoned sorcerers throw their rods on the floor, and they appear to change into snakes 🐍 by the effect of their magic. At first, Musa becomes concerned witnessing the tricks of the magicians, but is assured by God to not be worried. When Musa does the same his rod, the serpent devours all the sorcerers' snakes. The sorcerers realize that they have witnessed a miracle. They proclaim belief in the message of Musa and fall onto their knees in prostration despite threats from the Pharaoh. The Pharaoh is enraged by this and accuses them of working under Musa. He warns them that if they insist in believing in Musa, he would cut their hands and feet on opposite sides, and crucify them on the trunks of palm trees for their betrayal of the Pharaoh. The magicians, however, remain steadfast to their newfound faith and are punished by Pharaoh.

    He (Pharaoh) said: "Have you come to drive us out of our land with your magic, 0 Moses? Then verily, we can produce magic the like thereof, so appoint a meeting between us and you, which neither we, nor you shall fail to keep, in an open wide place where both shall have a just and equal chance (and beholders could witness the competition)."

    (Moses) said: "Your appointed meeting is the day of the festival, and let the people assemble when the sun has risen (forenoon)."

    So Pharaoh withdrew, devised his plot and then came back.

    Moses said to them: "Woe unto you! Invent not a lie against Allah, lest He should destroy you completely by a torment. And surely, he who invents a lie (against Allah) will fail miserably."

    Then they debated with one another what they must do, and they kept their talk secret. They said: "Verily! These are two magicians. Their object is to drive you out from your land with magic, and overcome your chiefs and nobles. So devise your plot, and then assemble in line. And whoever overcomes this day will be indeed successful."

    They said: "0 Moses! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?"

    (Moses) said: "Nay, throw you (first)!" Then behold, their ropes and their sticks, - by their magic, - appeared to him as though they moved fast. So Moses conceived a fear in himself.

    We (Allah) said: "Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician's trick, and the magician will never be successful, no matter whatever amount (of skill) he may attain."

    So the magicians fell down prostrate. They said: "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."

    (Pharaoh) said: "Believe you in him (Moses) before I give you permission? Verily! He is your chief who taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm-trees, and you shall surely know which of us I (Pharaoh) or the Lord of Moses (Allah) can give the severe and more lasting torment."

    They said: "We prefer you not over the clear signs that have come to us, and to Him (Allah) Who created us. So decree (regarding) this life of the world. Verily! We have believed in our Lord, that He may forgive us our faults, and the magic to which you did compel us. And Allah is better as regards reward in comparison to your (Pharaoh's) reward, and more lasting (as regards punishment in comparison to your punishment)." 
    Quran Ayah 20:58-73

## The Exodus

</summary>

### Plagues of Egypt

After losing against Musa, the Pharaoh continues to plan against Musa and the Israelites, ordering meetings with the ministers, princes and priests. According to the Quran, the Pharaoh is reported to have ordered his minister, Haman, to build a tower so that he "may look at the God of Musa". 

    Turning his face to the other side, Pharaoh asserted impatiently: "I know he is a liar." Then he looked towards Haman (and cried): "0 Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilah (God) of Moses but verily, I think him to be a liar."

    Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Pharaoh's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path, and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him). 
    Quran Ayah 40:36-37

Gradually, the Pharaoh begins to fear that Musa may convince the people that he is not the true god, and wants to have Musa killed. After this threat, a man from the family of Pharaoh, who had years ago warned Musa, comes forth and warns the people of the punishment of God for the wrongdoers and reward for the righteous. The Pharaoh defiantly refuses to allow the Israelites to leave Egypt.

    Pharaoh's terrorism infused the children of Israel with a spirit of defeat. They complained to Moses: "We (children of Israel) had suffered troubles before you came to us, and since you have come to us." He said: "It may be that your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors on the earth, so that He may see how you act." 
    Quran Ayah 7:129

#### Pharaoh's Relative Defends Moses
  
</summary>
  
When the Egyptians and children of Israel examined this miracle, the conflict between Moses and Pharaoh again reached a crisis because Pharaoh believed that Moses was threatening his kingdom.

Pharaoh was afraid that the people would be misled by Moses. He suggested to his ministers and notable men that Moses be killed. We believe that Haman supported the idea along with a front of disbelievers. It was on the verge of approval, except for the vote of one of the notable men of the state, whose name is not mentioned in the Qur'an. The Qur'an says only that this man was a believer.

This believer spoke in the assembly where the idea of killing Moses had been introduced. He proved that it was not a good idea: "Moses did not say more than that Allah is his Lord. Later, he came with clear evidence that he is a messenger. There are two possibilities: either Moses is righteous or a liar. If he lies, he will be responsible for his lie. If he is righteous and we slay him, where is the guarantee that we will be rescued from the torment of Allah? Either way, he neither says nor does anything that merits our killing him."

This angered Pharaoh and his counselors and they threatened to harm the man, but he refused to budge from his stance. They then tried to woo him back, but he still warned them that they were inviting their doom. This angered Pharaoh more, and he now threatened to kill the man. However, Allah protected His believer.

    Almighty Allah revealed their dialogue: Pharaoh said: "Leave me to kill Moses, and let him call his Lord (to stop me from killing him)! I fear that he may change your religion, or that he may cause mischief to appear in the land!"

    Moses said: "Verily, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant who believes not in the Day of Reckoning!"

    And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith said: "Would you kill a man because he says: My Lord is Allah, and he has come to you with clear signs (proofs) from your Lord? And if he is a liar, upon him will be (the sin of) his lie; but if he is telling the truth, then some of that (calamity) wherewith he threatens you will befall on you. Verily, Allah guides not one who is a Musrif (a polytheist, or a murderer who shed blood without a right, or those who commit great sins, oppressor, transgressor), a liar! 0 my people! Yours is the kingdom this day, you are uppermost in the land. But who will save us from the Torment of Allah, should it befall us?"

    Pharaoh said: "I show you only that which I see (correct), and I guide you only to the path of right policy!"

    And he who believed said: "0 my people! Verily, I fear for you a fate like that day (of disaster) of the confederates (of old)! Like the fate of the people of Noah, and 'Ad, and Thamud and those who came after them. And Allah wills no injustice for (His) slaves. And, 0 my people! Verily! I fear for you the Day when there will be mutual calling (between the people of Hell and of Paradise)."

    A Day when you will turn your backs and flee having no protector from Allah, and whomsoever Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide. And indeed Joseph did come to you, in times gone by, with clear signs, but you ceased not to doubt in that which he did bring to you, till when he died you said: "No Messenger will Allah send after him." Thus Allah leaves astray him who is a Musrif (a polytheist, oppressor, a criminal, sinner who commits great sins) and a Murtab (one who doubts Allah's warning and His Oneness). Those who dispute about the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah, without any authority that has come to them, it is greatly hateful in the Sight of Allah and in the sight of those who believe. Thus does Allah seal up the heart of every arrogant, tyrant. (So they cannot guide themselves to the Right Path).

    And Pharaoh said: "0 Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways, - the ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilah (God) of Moses but verily, I think him to be a liar."

    Thus it was made fair-seeming, in Pahraoh's eyes, the evil of his deeds, and he was hindered from the (Right) Path, and the plot of Pharaoh led to nothing but loss and destruction (for him).

    And the man who believed said: "0 my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct (i.e. guide you to Allah's Religion of Islamic Monotheism with which Moses has been sent). 0 my people! Truly, this life of the world is nothing but a (quick passing) enjoyment, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that will remain forever. Whosoever does an evil deed, will not be requited except the like thereof, and whosoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female and is a true believer (in the Oneness of Allah), such will enter Paradise, where they will be provided therein (with all things in abundance) without limit."

    "And 0 my People! How is it that I call you to salvation while you call me to the Fire! You invite me to disbelieve in Allah (and in His Oneness), and to join partners in worship with Him, of which I have no knowledge, and I invite you to the All-Mighty, the Oft-Forgiving! No doubt you call me to (worship) one who cannot grant (me) my request (or respond to my invocation) in this world or in the Hereafter. And our return will be to Allah, and Al-Musrifeen (i.e. polytheists and arrogants, those who commit great sins, the transgressors of Allah's set limits)! They shall be the dwellers of the Fire! And you will remember what I am telling you, and my affair I leave it to Allah. Verily, Allah is the All-Seer of (His) slaves."

    So Allah saved him from the evils that they plotted (against him), while an evil torment encompassed Pharaoh's people. 
    Quran Ayah 40:26-45
</details>

The Quran states that God decrees punishments over the pharaoh and his people. These punishments come in the form of floods that demolish their dwellings, swarms of locust that destroy the crops, pestilence of lice that makes their life miserable, toads that croak and spring everywhere, and the turning of all drinking water into blood. Each time the Pharaoh is subjected to humiliation, his defiance becomes greater. 

    As often as they were troubled grievously, they appealed to Moses thus: "0 Moses! Invoke your Lord for us because of His Promise to you. If you will remove the punishment from us, we indeed shall believe in you, and we shall let the children of Israel go with you."
    Quran Ayah 7:134

Moses prayed to his Lord and He relieved the suffering caused by the flood. The surging water ceased and withdrew from the land, and it became cultivatable. But when Moses bade them to fulfill their promise to release the children of Israel, they did not respond.

Then Allah sent swarms of locusts which ate whatever crops they had grown. The people hurried to Moses, asking him to invoke Allah to remove this affliction and promising they would send the children of Israel with him this time. The locusts departed, but they did not fulfill their promise.

    Almighty Allah said: And indeed We punished the people of Pharaoh with years of drought and shortness of fruits (crops, etc.), that they might remember (take heed). But whenever good came to them, they said: "Ours is this." And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed it to euil omens connected with Moses and those with him. Be informed! Verily, their evil omens are with Allah but most of them know not. They said (to Moses): "Whatever Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) you may bring to us, to work therewith your sorcery on us, we shall never believe in you." So We sent on them: the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood: (as a succession of) manifest signs, yet they remained arrogant, and they were of those people who were Mujrimeen (criminals, polytheists, sinners, etc.) 
    Quran Ayah 7:130-133

    Almighty Allah also said: But when We removed the punishment from them to a fixed term, which they had to reach, behold! They broke their word! Quran Ayah 7:135

Pharaoh became ruder and more arrogant. He proclaimed to his people: "Pharaoh is the only god. Has he not the kingdom of Egypt and rivers flowing under it?" He declared that Moses was a liar, a magician, and a poor man who did not wear even one bracelet of gold. 

    Almighty Allah declared: And indeed We did send Moses with Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) to Pharaoh and his chiefs (inviting them to Allah's Religion of Islam). He said: "Verily, I am a Messenger of the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists).

    But when he came to them with Our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) behold! They laughed at them. And not an Ayah (sign etc.) We showed them but it was greater than its fellow, and We seized them with torment, in order that they might turn from their polytheism to Allah's Religion (Islamic Monotheism).

    And they said (to Moses): "0 you sorcerer! Invoke your Lord for us according to what He has covenanted with you. Verily, we shall guide ourselves (aright)."

    But when We removed the torment from them, behold! They broke their covenant (that they will believe if We remove the torment for them).

    And Pharaoh proclaimed among his people, saying: '0 my people! Is not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these rivers flowing underneath me. See you not then? Am I not better than this one (Moses), who is Mahin has no honor nor any respect, and is weak and despicable and can scarcely express himself clearly? Why then are not golden bracelets bestowed on him, or angels sent along with him?"

    Thus he (Pharaoh) befooled and misled his people, and they obeyed him. Verily, they were Fasiqeen (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).
    Quran Ayah 43:46-55

### Splitting of the sea

It appeared that Pharaoh would never believe in Moses's message, nor would he stop the torture of the children of Israel. Therefore, Moses prayed to his Lord thus: 

    "Our Lord! You have indeed bestowed on Pharaoh and his chiefs splendor and wealth in the life of this world, our Lord! That they may lead men astray from Your Path. Our Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their hearts, so that they will not believe until they see the painful torment."

    Allah said: "Verily, the invocation of you both is accepted. So you both keep to the Straight Way (i.e. keep on doing good deeds and preaching Allah's Message with patience), and follow not the path of those who know not (the truth i.e. to believe in the Oneness of Allah, and also to believe in the Reward of Allah: Paradise etc.)." 
    Quran Ayah 10:88-89

Allah inspired Moses to conduct his people out of Egypt, but only a few of his people believed in his message. Allah revealed: But none believed in Moses except the offspring of his people, because of the fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they should persecute them; and verily, Pharaoh was an arrogant tyrant on the earth, he was indeed one of the Musrifeen (polyt heists, sinners and transgressors, those who give up the truth and follow the evil, and commit all kinds of great sins).

The Quran mentions that God instructs Musa to travel at night with the Israelites and warns them that they would be pursued. The Pharaoh chases the Israelites with his army after realizing that they have left during the night.

Having escaped and now being pursued by the Egyptians, the Israelites stop when they reach the seafront. The Israelites exclaim to Musa that they would be overtaken by Pharaoh and his army. In response, God commands Musa to strike the Red Sea with his staff, instructing them not to fear being inundated or drowning in sea water. Upon striking the sea, Musa splits it into two parts, forming a path that allows the Israelites to pass through. The Pharaoh witnesses the sea splitting alongside his army, but as they also try to pass through, the sea closes in on them. As he is about to die, Pharaoh proclaims belief in the God of Musa and the Israelites, but his belief is rejected by God. The Quran states that the body of the Pharaoh is made a sign and warning for all future generations. 

    Almighty Allah narrated: And We inspired Moses, saying: "Take away My slaves by night, verily, you will be pursued." Then Pharaoh sent callers to (all) the cities. (Saying): "Verily! These indeed are but a small band. And verily, they have done what has enraged us; but we are host all assembled, amply fore-warned."

    So, We expelled them from gardens and springs, treasures, and every kind of honorable place. Thus We turned them (Pharaoh's people) out and We caused the children of Israel to inherit them.

    So they pursued them at sunrise. And when the two hosts saw each other, the people of Moses said: "We are sure to be overtaken."

    Moses said: "Nay, verily! With me is my Lord, He will guide me."

    Then We inspired Moses (saying): "Strike the sea with your stick." And it parted, and each separate (part of that sea water) became like the huge, firm mass of a mountain.

    Then We brought near the others (Pharaoh's party) to that place. And We saved Moses and all those with him. Then We drowned the others. Verily! In this is indeed a sign (or a proof), yet most of them are not believers. And verily, your Lord! He is truly the All-Mighty, the Most Merciful." Quran Ayah 26:52

Terror-stricken Pharaoh, realizing that his end had come, declared out of fear: "I believe that there is no god worthy of worship except Allah in Whom the children of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender to Him." But Allah did not accept this declaration from the tyrant, and the waters closed over him, drowning him and his entire army.

    And We took the children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts followed them in oppression and enmity, till when drowning overtook him, he said: "I believe that La ilaha illa (Huwa): (none has the right to be worshiped but) He, in whom the children of Israel believe, and I am one of the Muslims (those who submit to Allah's Will)."

    Now (you believe) while you refused to believe before and you were one of the Mufsideen (evil-doers, corrupts, etc.). So this day We shall deliver your (dead) body (out from the sea) that you may be a sign to those who come after you! And verily, many among mankind are heedless or our Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.). 
    Quran Ayah 10:90-92

And after escaping the pharaoh with the help of Allah, Israelites continue their long journey to the Promised Land.

</details><details><summary>

## Revelation of The Torah

</summary>

After leaving Egypt, the Israelites continue their journey to the Promised Land. Musa leads the Israelites to Mount Sinai (Tur). Upon arrival, Musa leaves the people, instructing them that Harun is to be their leader during his absence. Musa is commanded by God to fast for thirty days and to then proceed to the valley of Tuwa for guidance. God orders Musa to fast again for ten days before returning. After completing his fasts, Musa returns to the spot where he had first received his miracles from God. He takes off his shoes as before and goes down into prostration. Musa prays to God for guidance and begs God to reveal himself to him. It is narrated in the Quran that God tells him that it would not be possible for Musa to perceive God, but that He would reveal himself to the mountain, stating: 

    "By no means canst thou see Me (direct); But look upon the mount; if it abide in its place, then shalt thou see Me." When God reveals himself to the mountain, it instantaneously turns into ashes, and Musa loses consciousness. When he recovers, he goes down in total submission and asks forgiveness of God.

Musa is then given the **Ten Commandments** by God as Guidance and as Mercy. Meanwhile, in his absence, a man named Samiri creates a Golden Calf, proclaiming it to be the God of Musa. The people begin to worship it. 

### The Israelites worship a golden calf 🐄

Moses had been gone for forty days and his people were becoming restless, for they did not know that Allah had extended his time by a further ten days. Samiri, a man who was inclined towards evil, suggested that they find themselves another guide, as Moses had broken his promise. He said to them: "In order to find true guidance, you need a god, and I shall provide one for you."

So he collected all their gold jewelry, dug a hole in which he placed the lot, and lit a huge fire to melt it down. During the casting, he threw a handful of dust, making actions like a magician's to impress the ignorant. From the molten metal he fashioned a golden calf. It was hollow, and the wind passing through it produced a sound. Since superstition was imbedded in their past, they quickly linked the strange sound to something supernatural, as if it were a living god. Some of them accepted the golden calf as their god.

Harun attempts to guide Israelites away from the Golden Calf, but the Israelites refuse to do so until Musa returns. 

    Almighty Allah narrated: They said: "We broke not the promise to you, of our own will, but we were made to carry the weight of the ornaments of the (Pharaoh's) people, then we cast them (into the fire), and that was what As-Samiri suggested."

    Then he took out (of the fire) for them a statue of a calf which seemed to low. They said: "This is your ilah (god), and the ilah (god) of Moses, but (Moses) has forgotten (his god)."

    Did they not see that it could not return them a word (for answer), and that it had no power either to harm them or to do them good?

    And Aaron indeed had said to them beforehand: "0 my people! You are being tried in this, and verily, your Lord is (Allah) the Most Beneficent, so follow me and obey my order."

    They said: "We will not stop worshipping it (i.e. the calf), until Moses returns to us." Quran Ayah 20:87-91

Musa, having thus received the scriptures for his people, is informed by God that the Israelites has been tested in his absence, and they have gone astray by worshiping the Golden Calf. 

    (Allah) said: "Verily! We have tried your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has led them astray."

Musa comes down from the mountain and returns to his people. The Quran states that Musa, in his anger, grabs hold of Harun by his beard and admonishes him for doing nothing to stop them, but when Harun tells Musa of his fruitless attempt to stop them, Musa understands his helplessness, and they both pray to God for forgiveness. Musa then questions Samiri for creating the Golden Calf. Samiri replies that it had simply occurred to him, and he had done so. Samiri is exiled, and the Golden Calf is burned to ashes, and the ashes are thrown into the sea. The wrong-doers who have worshipped the Calf are ordered to be punished for their crime.

Musa then chooses 70 elites from among the Israelites and orders them to pray for forgiveness. Shortly thereafter, the elders travel alongside Musa to witness the speech between Musa and God.

Moses returned to Mount Sinai with the seventy elders and there he communicated with Allah. The elders heard Moses speaking with his Lord. (Allah spoke to Moses directly.) This was, perhaps, the last miracle that they would see, and it was hoped that it would be sufficient enough to convey the religion to their hearts forever. However, the seventy elite who heard the miracle were dissatisfied. 

    They said to Moses: "0 Moses! We shall never believe in you till we see Allah plainly. " Quran Ayah 2:35

Despite witnessing the speech between them, they refuse to believe until they see God with their own eyes, so as punishment, a thunderbolt kills them. Musa prays for their forgiveness, and they are resurrected. They return to camp and set up a tent dedicated to worshiping God, as Harun had taught them from the Torah. They resume their journey towards the Promised Land.

    And Moses chose out of his people seventy (of the best) men for Our appointed time and place of meeting, and when they were seized with a violent earthquake, he said: "0 my Lord, if it had been Your Will, You could have destroyed them and me before; would You destroy us for the deeds of the foolish ones among us? It is only Your Trial by which You lead astray whom You will, and keep guided whom You will. You are our Wali (Protector), so forgive us and have Mercy on us, for You are the Best of Those who forgive. And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter. Certainly we have turned unto You."
    Quran Ayah 7:155

## Israelites and a cow 🐄 

</summary>
  
Islamic exegesis narrates the incident of an old and pious man who lives among the Israelites and earns his living honestly. 

It was said that among the children of Israel there lived a pious man. He was poor but very careful about how he earned his living; it had to be honestly earned. Everything that he did was done for the sake of Allah, never for selfish gain. On his deathbed his last words were: "0 Allah, I place my wife, my little son, and my only possession, a calf, in Your care." Strangely, he asked his wife to lead the calf to the forest and leave it there. He did this because he did not trust the children of Israel, for they were a selfish and greedy folk.

After a few years when the boy had grown up, his mother told him: 'Your father has left you a calf in the trust of Allah. It must have grown into a cow by now." The son was surprised. He did not know of any calf all these years and asked his mother where it was. She replied: "Be like your father and say: 'I trust in Allah,' then go look for it."

With a rope in his hand, he went to the forest and prostrated himself before Allah: "0 Allah, Lord of Abraham and Jacob and Job, return to me my father's trust." As he raised his head, he saw a cow coming towards him. It stopped submissively beside him. He tied the rope around its neck and led it to his house. The cow would not allow anyone else come near it except the young man.

The youth was as pious as his father. He earned his living by cutting wood. Whatever he earned he divided into three equal portions: one he gave to his mother, one he used for his needs, and the last he gave as charity. His nights, too, were divided into three parts: during the early part of the night he helped his mother, the middle part he devoted to the worship of Allah, and during the last part he rested.

#### The People Ask Questions About a Cow

About this time a wealthy man died, leaving behind an only son, who inherited his father's wealth. His cousins envied his good fortune and secretly killed him so that they could inherit it.

The dead boy's other relatives came to the Prophet Moses and asked his help in tracing the boy's murderer. Moses instructed them to slaughter a cow, remove its tongue and place it on the corpse. This would reveal the murderer, he told them. They accused Moses of joking. He replied: "Allah forbid that I be foolish!" They questioned him about the type of cow they should slaughter, and he said: "This cow is neither young nor mature, but in between the two conditions, so do as you have been commanded."

Instead of following his direction, they asked him more questions. "What color must it be?"

He replied: "Verily, it is yellow in color."

They still were not satisfied with his answer and asked for more details. Moses replied: "It is an unyoked cow; it does not plow the soil nor water the tilth, and is entirely without marks."

#### Moses's People Find the Right Cow

They went out in search of such a cow. The only one that matched the description was the one owned by the orphaned youth. They met him on the way and asked the price for which he would sell his cow. He told them he would have to consult his mother first, so they accompanied him to his house and offered her three gold coins. She refused their offer, saying that the cow was worth much more.

They went on increasing their offer and the mother kept on refusing. Finally they urged the son to speak to his mother to be reasonable. He told them: "I will not sell the cow without my mother's approval, even if you offered me its skin filled with gold!" On hearing this, his mother smiled and said: "Let that be the price: its skin filled with gold." They realized that no other cow would do; they had to have it at any price. They agreed to buy the cow and paid with its skin filled with gold.

    Allah the Almighty narrated: And (remember) when Moses said to his people: "Verily, Allah commands you that you slaughter a cow.

    They said: "Do you make fun of us?"

    He said: "I take Allah's Refuge from being among AlJahileen (the ignorants or the foolish)."

    They said: "Call upon your Lord for us that He may make plain to us what it is!"

    He said: "He says, 'Verily, it is a cow neither too old nor too young, but (it is) between the two conditions; so do what you are commanded."

    They said: "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us its color."

    He said: "He says, 'It is a yellow cow bright in its color, pleasing to the beholders.

    They said: "Call upon your Lord for us to make plain to us what it is. Verily to us all cows are alike, and surely, if Allah wills, we will be guided."

    He (Moses) said: "He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields, sound, having no other color except bright yellow.

    They said: "Now you have brought the truth." So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it.

    And (remember) when you killed a man and fell into dispute among yourselves as to the crime. But Allah brought forth that which you were hiding. So We said: "Strike him (the dead man) with apiece of it (the cow)." Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) so that you may understand.

    Then after that your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness. And indeed, there are stones out of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there are of them (stones) which fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do. 
    Quran Ayah 2:67-74

#### Korah (Qaroun) refuses to pay zakat

Moses began to face a difficult situation. He had to confront Pharaoh's anger and his plots, while at the same time he had to deal with the mutiny of his people. In the midst of all this, Korah (Qaroun) moved.

Korah was a one of Moses's people. He was very rich and lived in a magnificent mansion. He wore only the most expensive clothes. Numerous slaves waited on him and he indulged in every known luxury. His enormous wealth made him arrogant. Korah treated the poor with contempt and told them that their poverty was due to their lack of intelligence. He believed that what he owned was due to his own cleverness and business ability.

Moses reminded Korah to pay alms (zakat) on his wealth, a portion of which was rightfully due to the poor. Alms are compulsory upon all the believers. Korah was annoyed by this advice and told Moses that his being wealthy was proof that he was favored by Allah, Who approved of his life-style and increased his wealth daily. Moses argued with him and warned him of the result of his wicked thoughts.

When Korah did calculate the alms due on his wealth, he was shocked at the large amount he had to part with. He not only refused to give alms, but spread a rumor that Moses had invented the law of zakat for his own gain. He even bribed people to oppose Moses and to spread wicked rumors about him.

Allah warned Moses of Korah's plot. Moses appealed to Allah to punish him for his stinginess and for defying His laws. Allah's anger fell on Korah. The earth opened up and swallowed him, his mansion and all his wealth, as if he had never existed.

    Almighty Allah revealed: Verily, Korah was of Moses's people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men. When his people said to him: "Do not be glad (with ungratefulness to Allah's Favors). Verily! Allah likes not those who are glad (with ungratefulness to Allah's Favors). But seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not the Mufsideen (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupts)."

    He said: "This has been given to me only because of knowledge I possess." Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected. But the Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers, polyt heists, sinners, etc.) will not be questioned of their sins (because Allah knows them well, so they will be punished without account). So he went forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that we had the like of what Korah has been given! Verily! He is the owner of a great fortune."

    But those who had been given (religious) knowledge said: "Woe to you! The Reward of Allah (in the Hereafter) is better for those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient (in following the truth)."

    So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. And those who had desired (for a position like) his position the day before, began to say: "Know you not that it is Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves? Had it not been that Allah was Gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)!" Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful? 
    Quran Ayah 28:76-82

## Meeting with Al-Khidr

</summary>

Al-Khidr is a figure described but not mentioned by name in the Quran as a righteous servant of God possessing great wisdom or mystic knowledge

The story of Moses and Al-Khidr is also told in a hadith. 
> Said Ibn Jubair said: "I said to Ibn Abbas, 'Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khidr, was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some other Moses.' Ibn Abbas said: 'Allah's enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai Ibn Kab told us that the Prophet said: Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said: "I." Allah admonished him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him: 'Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Mine who is more learned than you." Moses said: "0 my Lord! How can I meet him?" Allah said: "Take a fish and put it in a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish."

> Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Joshua (Yusha Ibn Nun), till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept, and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They traveled the rest of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant): "Give us our food, for indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours." Moses did not feel tired till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant) said to him: "Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the sea in an amazing way?" So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses said: 'This is exactly what we are seeking!"

They hurriedly retraced their steps to the place where the rivers met and where the fish had jumped out. There they found a man, his face partly covered with a hood. His bearing showed he was a saintly man. He was Al-Khidr, the guide.

    Allah the Almighty narrated: And (remember) when Moses said to his boy-servant: "I will not give up (traveling) until I reach the junction of the two seas or (until) I spend years and years in traveling."

    But when they reached the junction of the two seas, they forgot their fish, and it took its way throught the sea as in a tunnel. So when they had passed further on (beyond that fixed place), Moses said to his boy-servant: "Bring us our morning meal; truly, we have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey."

    He said: "Do you remember when we betook ourselves to the ock? I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a strange (way)!"

    (Moses) said: "That is what we have been seeking." So they went back retracing their footsteps.

    Then they found one of Our slaves, unto whom We had bestowed mercy from Us, and whom We had taught knowledge from Us. 
    Quran Ayah 18:60-65

### Moses Speaks to Al-Khidr

    Moses said to him (Khidr) "May I follow you so that you teach me something of that knowledge (guidance and true path) which you have been taught (by Allah)?"

    He (Khidr) said: "Verily! You will not be able to have patience with me! And how can you have patience about a thing which you know not?"

    Moses said: "If Allah will, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in aught."

    He (Khidr) said: "Then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything till I myself mention it to you.

    So they both proceeded, till, when they were in the ship, he (Khidr) scuttled it. Moses said: "Have you scuttled it in order to drown its people? Verily, you have done Imra - a Munkar (evil, bad, dreadful) thing."

    He (Khidr) said: "Did I not tell you, that you would not be able to have patience with me?"

    (Moses) said: "Call me not to account for what I forgot, and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you)."

    Then they both proceeded, till they met a boy, he (Khidr) killed him. Moses said: "Have you killed an innocent person who had killed none? Verily, you have done Nukra a great Munkar (prohibited, evil, dreadful) thing!"

    (Khidr) said: "Did I not tell you that you can have no patience with me?"

    (Moses) said: "If I ask you anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me."

    Then they both proceeded, till, when they came to the people of a town, they asked them for food, but they refused to entertain them. Then they found therein a wall about to collapse and he (Khidr) set it up straight. (Moses) said: "If you had wished, surely you could have taken wages for it!"

    (Khidr) said: "This is the parting between me and you. I will tell you the interpretation of (those) things over which you were unable to hold patience.

    'As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working in the sea. So I wished to make a defective damage in it, as there was a king after them who seized every ship by force.

    "And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief. So we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy.

    "And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town; and there was under it a treasure belonging to them; and their father was a righteous man, and your Lord intended that they should attain their age of full strength and take out their treasure as a mercy from your Lord. And I did it not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of those (things) over which you could not hold patience. Quran Ayah 18:60-82

## Death of Musa

</summary>

His people were still wandering in the wilderness when he died. 

Abu Hurairah narrated: 
> Azrail the Angel of Death was sent to Moses. When he came to Moses, Moses slapped him on the eye. The Angel returned to his Lord and said: You have sent me to a slave who does not want to die.' Allah said: 'Return to him and tell him to put his hand on the back of an ox and for every hair that will come under it, he will be granted one year of life.' Moses said: '0 Lord! What will happen after that?' Allah replied: 'Then death.' Moses said: 'Let it come now!' Moses then requested Allah to let him die close to the Holy Land so that he would be at a distance of a stone's throw from it." Abu Hurairah added: "Allah's Messenger said: 'If I were there, I would show you his grave below the red sandhill on the side of the road."

According to Bible, Moses also dies very close to The Promised Land (also known as "The Land of Milk and Honey", is the land which, according to the Tanakh (the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament), God promised and subsequently gave to Abraham and to his descendants).

# 6. Jewish Prophets and Kings
*******************************************

> 1st millenium BCE

<details><summary>

## Shammil and Talut -- Samuel and King Saul

</summary>

> Samuel (Shammil) is not mentioned by name in the Qur'an, but referred to as a "prophet". The narrative of Samuel in Islam focuses specifically on his birth and the appointing of Talut a king (traditionally identified as Saul).
> 
> According to Islamic narrative, Israelites after Moses wanted a strong king to rule over their country and to lead them to victory. Allah sent prophet Shammil to help Israelites choose Saul as a king. Israelites mocked Saul but then agreed after seeing a sign from God. 
> 
> Saul led them to a battle against Philistines and Goliath. Allah revealed to Saul that Israelities must not drink from one particular river but a part of people drank from the river and were not allowed to fight in the name of Allah. Despite righteous Israelites were scarse in numbers, Allah granted them victory.

In the Islamic narrative, the Israelites after Moses wanted a king 👑 to rule over their country. Thus, God sent a prophet, Samuel, to anoint Talut as the first king for the Israelites. However, the Israelites mocked and reviled the newly appointed king, as he was not wealthy from birth. But, assuming Talut to be Saul, in sharp contrast to the Hebrew Bible, the Qur'an praises Saul greatly, and mentions that he was gifted with great spiritual and physical strength. In the Qur'anic account, Samuel prophesies that the sign of Talut's kingship will be that the Ark of the Covenant will come back to the Israelites.

Ibn Jarir reported that the condition of the Israelites deteriorated. They committed many sins and killed whom they wished of the prophets. Consequently Allah sent them tyrannous kings who ill-treated them and spilled their blood, and set their enemies from outside against them as well. They used to go to war, taking with them The Ark of the Covenant. They did this so that they would be victorious by its blessing, and it became a symbol of calm and a relic left behind by Moses's people. When they went to war with the people of Gaza and Askalon, they were defeated because the Ark of the Covenant was captured from them. When the king of the Israelites heard of this he died on the spot.

The children of Israel remained like sheep without a shepherd until Almighty Allah sent them a prophet named Samuel (Shammil). They asked him to appoint a king over them to lead them in a war against their enemies.

According to Ibn Asaker, the Israelites believed their Ark of the Covenant to be very holy and an important symbol of their history. They carried the Ark even in battle and believed that, because of it, Allah would protect them from their enemies. This belief gave them peace of mind and great courage, and their enemies were terrified by it. Their enemies also believed that it was given special power by Allah. Gradually the Israelites started to ignore Allah's law; evil habits became part of their lives. Allah sent upon them an enemy, the Philistines, who defeated the Israelites, captured their Ark, drove them out of their homes, and took away their children to use or sell as slaves. Their power was broken. They separated from one another and were very disheartened.

Then came Prophet Samuel among them to bring some relief. They asked the prophet's help in appointing a strong leader, a king under whose banner they could unite and fight the Philistines. Prophet Samuel, knowing their weakness, told them: "I fear that when the time comes to fight you may refuse." But they assured him that they had suffered enough insults and were now ready to fight in the way of God, even if they lost their lives.

Prophet Samuel prayed to Allah for guidance. Allah revealed to him that He had chosen one, Saul (Talut), to be their king. The prophet wanted to know how to recognize the future king. He was told that Saul would come to him by himself and that they should then hand over the control of the kingdom to him, for he would lead them in battle against the Philistines.

### Saul is chosen to be the king of Israelites 👑

Saul was tall and sturdy, pious, and very intelligent. He lived and worked with his father on their farm. One day, several of their donkeys were lost. Accompanied by his servant, Saul went in search of them. They traveled for many days and were very tired. Saul said to his servant: "Let us rather go back, for I am sure that my father will be worried by now, and the other animals must also be cared for." His servant suggested that as they were already in the land of Samuel the prophet, they should go to him to inquire about the lost donkeys.

Saul agreed, and they carried on. On their way, they asked directions from some maidens carrying water. They were told to go in the direction of the mountain. Here, a vast crowd was waiting for the Prophet Samuel. When Saul set eyes on him, he instantly recognized him as a prophet by his holy mien. Samuel also recognized Saul as the king that Allah had chosen for them. Saul greeted the prophet respectfully. When he asked about his missing donkeys, Samuel told him not to worry, his donkeys were already on their way to his father's farm.

He then told Saul that Allah had chosen him as the king of the children of Israel. His duty would be to take charge of their affairs, to unite them under one banner, and to protect them from their enemies. If he carried out Allah's commands, he would be given victory. Saul was surprised by this sudden honor offered to him. It was also a heavy responsibility. He protested to the prophet that he was of the Children of Benjamin, the least famous of the tribes of Jacob; he did not know anything of leadership or kingship and had no wealth. Samuel told him that it was the will of Allah that he should be the king, that he should thank Allah for His favor and be strong in faith.

### Battle against Goliath and Philistines

Taking Saul by the hand, Samuel led him to the children of Israel, but they insisted on a direct sign from Allah. Prophet Samuel told them to go outside the city to see the sign, which they did. Allah revealed: 

    "Have you not thought about the group of children of Israel after (the time of ) Moses? When they said to a Prophet of theirs: "Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allah's Way."
    
    He said: "Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you?"
    
    They said: "Why should we not fight in Allah's Way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)?"
    
    But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the Zalimeen (polytheists, and wrongdoers).
    
    And their Prophet (Samuel) said to them: "Indeed Allah has appointed Saul as a king over you."
    
    They said: "How can he be a king over us when we are better fitted than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth."
    
    He said: "Verily, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His Kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs, All-Knower."
    
    And their Prophet (Samuel) said to them: "Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At Tabut (a wooden box), wherein is Sakinah (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Moses and Aaron left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers."

    Then when Saul set out with the army, he said: "Verily! Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes thereof in the hollow of his hand."
    
    Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: "We have no power on this day against Goliath and his hosts."
    
    But those who knew with certainty that they were to meet their Lord, said: "How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's Leave?" And Allah is with the patient.
    
    And when they advanced to meet Goliath and his forces, they invoked. "Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience and make us victorious over the disbelieving people." 
    Quran Surah 2:246-250

Saul set about organizing his army with strong faith and wisdom. He ordered that only men free from responsibilities should join. Those engaged in building homes, men who were about to be married and those occupied with business should not join.

After establishing a well-trained army, he decided to put them to the test. He told them that along the route they would pass a river where they should drink enough water to quench their thirst but not more than that. To his disappointment, he discovered the majority of them drank more water than they should have. He discharged them for disobedience and kept only the few who had obeyed him, as they were the ones who proved their sincerity. This resulted in a split in the army, but he was not bothered. He believed in quality and not numbers; better a small band of true believers he could rely on than a huge army of unreliable men.

Saul's men sighted the enemy on the other side of the river. Their opponents appeared physically strong and were armed with better weapons. They were led by the mighty warrior Goliath (Galut), known for his huge build and brute strength. A great number of Saul's men ran away on seeing this strong force. The small band that remained was willing to fight, whatever the outcome, for they had heard that there had been many incidents in the past in which Allah had caused a small force to defeat a larger one.

## Davud (David)

</summary>

Dawud is known as biblical David who was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah, reigning c. 1010–970 BCE.

Dawud (David), is a prophet and messenger of God and is righteous, divinely-anointed monarch of the United Kingdom of Israel. Additionally, Muslims honor David for having received the divine revelation of the Zabur (Psalms). Dawud is mentioned sixteen times in the Quran. Although he is not usually considered one of the "law-giving" prophets (ulū al-ʿazm), he is a significant figure in Islamic thought. In later Islamic traditions, he is praised for his rigor in prayer and fasting. He is also presented as the prototypical just ruler and as a symbol of God's authority on earth, having been at once a king 👑 and a prophet.

### Narrative in the Quran

    And when they went forth to [face] Goliath and his soldiers, they said, "Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people."
    Quran Al-Baqara 2: Verse 250
    
    So they defeated them by permission of Allah, and Dawud killed Goliath, and Allah gave him the kingship and prophethood and taught him from that which He willed. And if it were not for Allah checking [some] people by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted, but Allah is full of bounty to the worlds.
    Quran Al-Baqara 2: Verse 251

David's narrative in the Quran, in many respects, parallels that given in the Bible. He is named a prophet (nabī) and also a messenger (rasūl), David is included in lists of those who received revelation (waḥy; Q4:163) or guidance (hudā; 6:84) from God. In both lists his name appears next to that of his son Solomon. Elsewhere, the Quran explains that God gave to both of them the gifts of "sound judgment" (ḥukm; 21:79) and "knowledge" (ʿilm; 21:79; 27:15). 

Yet the Quran also ascribes to David merits that distinguish him from Solomon: David killed Goliath (2:251) and received a divine revelation named "the Psalms" (Quran 17:55 uses an indefinite form, while 21:105 uses the definite form al-Zabūr), presumably a reference to the Psalms or the Psalter. The mountains and the birds 🐦🐦 praised God along with David (21:79; in 34:10 God commands them to do so; cfr. Psalm 148:7–10). God made David a "vicegerent" (khalīfa; 38:26), a title that the Quran otherwise gives only to Adam (2:30). This title suggests that, according to the Quran, David was something more than a messenger: he was a divinely guided leader who established God's rule on Earth. This role is also suggested by 2:251: 

    "God gave him authority (mulk) and wisdom (ḥikmah) and taught him what He willed. If God did not drive back some people by others, the earth would become corrupt."

Among the things taught to David was the ability to make armour (21:80, 34:10–11), a suggestion that David’s military exploits were the act of God. It is also important that the Quranic reference to David's "wisdom" was sometimes explained by the classical exegetes as the gift of prophecy. The Quran also connects David and Jesus, by insisting that both cursed those Israelites who did not believe (5:78). Moreover, according to the Quran, David was given the ability to distinguish between truth and falsehood when dispensing justice (faṣl al-khiṭāb, 38:20). Furthermore, there is the allusion to a test David was put through, wherein he prayed and repented and God forgave him (38:24-5). Surah Sad (38th chapter of the Quran) is also called "the sūra of David". Exegetes explain that since David prostrated when asking God to forgive him, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was ordered to imitate him and to perform a prostration when reading this chapter.

### Religious significance

David is one of the few Islamic Prophets who received Kingship as well. While other prophets preached during the reign of kings, David, in his time, was the king. Thus, he received an extremely large task, of making sure that the people of Israel were not only held in check spiritually but that the country itself remained strong as well. His place as both leader and prophet is revered by all Muslims as one of extremely high rank. The figure of David, together with that of his prophetic son, Solomon, are iconic of people who ruled justly over their land. God frequently mentions David's high rank as a prophet and messenger in the Quran. He is often mentioned alongside other prophets to emphasize how great he was. For example, God says:

    And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus We reward those who are upright and do good.
    Quran 6:84

When the Caliph 'Umar visited Jerusalem, the Patriarch Sophronius accompanied him on the Temple Mount, while he searched for the Mihrab Dawud (David's prayer-niche) to perform a prayer. Later commentators identified this site with the Tower of David. In a hadith, the prayer and fasting of David is mentioned to be dear to God.

Narrated Abdullah bin 'Amr bin Al-'As: 

> The Apostle of Allah told me, "The most beloved prayer to Allah is that of David and the most beloved fasts to Allah are those of David. He used to sleep for half of the night and then pray for one third of the night and again sleep for its sixth part and used to fast on alternate days."
> — Muhammad al-Bukhari, Sahih al-Bukhari

### The Book of David: Zabur

The Zabur is the holy book attributed to David by God, just as Musa (Moses) received the Tawrat (Torah), Isa (Jesus) received the Injil (Gospel) and prophet Muhammad ﷺ   received the Quran. In the current Hebrew Bible, the Zabur is known as the Psalms. However, like other scriptures of the past, the Psalms are believed to have been corrupted over time, with some of the original message now gone. Nonetheless, Muslims are told to treat the present Psalms with immense respect because, in their original form, they too were an inspired Book of God. The Quran states:

    Your Lord knows whoever is in the heavens and the earth. We exalted some of the prophets over the others; and to David We gave the Book of Psalms.
    Quran 17:55

The term Zabur is the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew Zimra, meaning "song/music." It, along with Zamir ("song") and Mizmor ("Psalm"), is a derivative of Zamar, meaning "sing", "sing praise", "make music". Thus, David is also usually attributed the gifts of music and song.

## Sulaiman -- Solomon Son of David

</summary>

Sulaimān ibn Dāwūd (Solomon son of David) was, according to the Quran, a malik (king) and Nabī (Prophet) of the Israelites. Islamic tradition generally holds that he was the third king 👑 of Jewish people, and a wise ruler for the nation.

Islam views Solomon as one of the prophets of God, who was bestowed with many God-given gifts, including the ability to speak to animals and [jinn](#era-of-jinns-devils-or-spirits). After his father's death, Solomon became king. He begged Allah for a kingdom such as none after him would have, and Allah granted his wish. Besides wisdom, Allah had blessed Solomon with many abilities. He could command the winds and understand and talk to birds and animals. Allah directed him to teach both men and jinns to mine the earth and extract its minerals to make tools and weapons. He also favored him with a mine of copper, which was a rare metal in those days

Muslims further maintain that he remained faithful to the one and only God throughout his life; and reigned justly over the whole of the Israelites; was blessed with a level of kingship which was given to none after him and before him; and fulfilled all of his commandments, being promised nearness to God in Paradise at the end of his life. Arab historians regarded Solomon as one of the greatest rulers around the world.

    And (We made subservient) to Sulayman, the wind blowing violent, pursuing its course by his command to the land which We had blessed and we are knower of all things: And of the rebellious people there were those who dived for him and did other work besides that; and we kept guard over them;
    
    And Sulayman was Dawud’s heir, and he said, O men! we have been tangent the language of birds, and we have been given all things; most surely this is manifest grace. 
    Quran 38:34-35

Unlike the Talmudic tradition, Solomon was unaware and never participated in idolatry. And the Quran rejects that Solomon was a magician: 

    "(...) Solomon did not disbelieve, but the devils disbelieved, teaching men magic and (...)". (2:102)

### Judgment on the field

In the earliest narrative involving Solomon, the Quran (21:78) briefly alludes to a story that Solomon was in the company of his father, when two men came to ask David to judge between them regarding a ḥarth (field). Later Muslim commentators expanded on the allusion, including Al-Tabari, Baidawi, and Ibn Kathir. They said that the first of the two men said that he owned a vineyard of which he took great care the whole year through. But one day, when he was absent, the other man's sheep had strayed into the vineyard and devoured the grapes. He asked to be compensated for this damage. Upon hearing the man's complaint, Solomon suggested that the owner of the sheep take the other man's vineyard to repair and cultivate until the vines returned to their former state, whereupon he should return it to its owner. At the same time, the owner of the vineyard would care for the sheep and benefit from their wool and milk until his land was returned to him, at which point he would return the sheep to their owner. 

Solomon's level of judgment, which the Quran says, would characterize Solomon throughout his life. Ḥikmah (Wisdom), according to Muslim tradition, would always be associated with Solomon, who would later even be referred to as Sulaimān al-Ḥakīm ("Solomon the Wise").

### Solomon and Jinns

When David died, Solomon inherited his position as the prophetic king of the Israelites. He prayed to God to grant him a kingdom which would be unlike any after him. God accepted Solomon's prayer and gave him what he pleased.

The Quran narrates that the wind was made subservient to Solomon, and he could control it at his own will, and that the jinn also came under Solomon's control. The jinn helped strengthen Solomon's reign. The devils (shayatin), and demons were forced to build for him monuments. God also caused a miraculous ʿayn (عَيْن, 'fount' or 'spring') of molten qiṭr (قِطْر, 'brass' or 'copper') to flow for Solomon, to be used by the demons in their construction.

    And (we made) the wind (subservient) to Sulayman, which made a month’s journey in the morning and a month’s journey in the evening and we made a fountain of molten copper to flow out for him; and of the jinn there were those who worked before him by the command of his Lord; and who ever turned aside from Our Command from among them, We made him taste of the punishment of burning. They made for him what he pleased of fortresses and usages, and bowls (large) as watering troughs and cooking pots that will not move from their place; give thanks, O family of Dawud! and very few of My Servants are grateful.
    
    And certainly We tried Sulayman and we put on his throne a (mere) body, so he turned (to Allah). He said, My Lord! do Thou forgive me and grant me a kingdom which is not fit for (being inherited by) anyone after me; surely Thou art the great Giver. Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever he desired, And the Shaitans, every builder and liver, And others fettered in chains, This is Our free gift, therefore give freely or with hold, with out reckoning.
    Quran, Surah 38

### Solomon and the Ant 🐜

Solomon was even taught the languages of various animals, such as ants. 

One day Solomon gathered his army, which had different battalions of men, jinns, birds, and animals. He marched them to the country of Askalon.

While they were passing through a valley, an ant saw the approaching army and cried out to warn the other ants: "Run to your homes! Otherwise, unaware, Solomon and his army might crush you!" Solomon, hearing the cry of the ant, smiled. He was glad that the ant knew him to be a prophet who would not intentionally harm Allah's creation. He thanked Allah for saving the ants' lives.

Immediately understanding what the ant said, Solomon, as always, prayed to God, thanking him for bestowing upon him such gifts and further avoided trampling over the ant colonies. Solomon's wisdom, however, was yet another of the gifts he received from God, and Muslims maintain that Solomon never forgot his daily prayer, which was more important to him than any of his gifts.

    At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said: "O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it."
    
    So he smiled, amused at her speech; and he said: "O my Lord! so order me that I may be grateful for Thy favours, which thou hast bestowed on me and on my parents, and that I may work the righteousness that will please Thee: And admit me, by Thy Grace, to the ranks of Thy righteous Servants."
    Quran 27:18-19

Exegetical literature emphasizes the ant's wisdom and explains the meaning behind Solomon's gift to control the wind. According to Siracü'l-Kulub, the ant asks Solomon if he knows why he is called "Solomon" (Süleyman). Solomon negates and the ant went on to explain: "Although your heart was sound (selim) and you know the circumstances of the next world, you have accepted a few pleassures of this world and have been deceived by its possesion and kingship; therefore you are called Solomon." Afterwards the ant asks Solomon, if he knows why God has subdued the wind for him. Once again, Solomon denies and the ant answers: "He has subdued the wind for a reason: that which you have accepted is nothing. Just as the wind passes, the world's wealth and kingship pass too." Scholars like Fakhr al-Din Razi and al-Qurtubi elevated the ant to the rank of an examplar for humans to follow.

### Conquest of Saba'

_Ruins of the Barran Temple at Ma'rib, the former capital of Saba' in what is now Yemen._

In Jerusalem, on a huge rock, Solomon built a beautiful temple to draw the people to worship Allah. Today this building is known as 'The Dome of the Rock." From there, a large band of followers joined Solomon on pilgrimage to the Holy Mosque in Mecca. After they had completed their hajj, they traveled to Yemen and arrived in the city of Sana.

Solomon was impressed by their clever method of channeling water all over their cities. He was keen to build similar water systems in his own country but did not have enough springs.

He set out to find the hoopoe bird, which could detect water under the ground. He sent signals all over for the hoopoe to call on him, but it was nowhere to be found. In anger, he declared that unless the bird had good reason for its absence, he would punish it severely.

The hoopoe eventually came to Solomon and explained the reason for its delay: 

    "I have compassed (territory) which thou hast not compassed, and I have come to thee from Saba' with tidings true." 

The Hud-hud further told Solomon that the people of Sheba worshiped the Sun, and that the woman who ruled the kingdom was highly intelligent and powerful. Solomon, who listened closely, chose to write a letter to the land of Sheba, through which he would try to convince the people of Sheba to cease in worshiping the Sun, and to come to the worship of God. Solomon ordered the Hud-hud to give the letter to the Queen of Sheba (Bilqis), and then to hide and observe her reaction. The Hud-hud accepted Solomon's orders, and flew to give the letter to her. The Queen then called her ministers in the court and announced the letter of Solomon stating to the people of Sheba.

    The hoopoe dropped the letter in front of the queen and flew away to hide. She excitedly opened and read it: "Verily! It is from Solomon, and verily! It (reads): 'In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful; be you not exalted against me, but come to me as Muslims (true believers who submit to Allah with full submission)." 
    Quran Ayah 27:30-31

She asked for suggestions from her minister and administration stating:

    "O my people, I know that you all are powerful and brave warriors, and no one on the face of the Earth can defeat our army, but still I want your opinion." The people of the court replied: "You have all the power, and whatever order you deliver, you will find us obedient." 

    She said: "0 chiefs! Verily! Here is delivered to me a noble letter. Verily! It is from Solomon, and verily! It (reads): 'In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful; Be you not exalted against me, but come to me as Muslims (true believers who submit to Allah with full submission)."

    She said: 'O chiefs! Advise me in (this) case of mine. I decide no case till you are present with me."

    They said: "We have great strength, and great ability for war, but it is for you to command; so think over what you will command."

    She said: "Verily! Kings, when they enter a town (country), they despoil it, and make the most honorable amongst its people low. And thus they do. But verily! I am going to send him a present, and see with what (answer) the messengers return."

    So when (the messengers with the present) came to Solomon, he said: "Will you help me in wealth? What Allah has given me is better than that which He has given you! Nay, you rejoice in your gift!" (Then Solomon said to the chief of her messengers who brought the present): "Go back to them. We verily shall come to them with hosts that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from there in disgrace, and they will be abased." 
    Quran Ayah 27:29-37

The queen's envoys returned with the gifts and delivered the message. They also told her of the wonderful things they had seen. Instead of taking offense, she decided to visit Solomon. Accompanied by her royal officials and servants, she left Sheba, sending a messenger ahead to inform Solomon that she was on her way to meet him.

Solomon asked the jinns in his employ whether anyone among them could bring her throne to the palace before she arrived. One of them said: "I will bring it to you before this sitting is over." Solomon did not react to this offer; it appeared that he was waiting for a faster means. The jinns competed with each other to please him. One of them named Ifrit said: "I will fetch it for you in the twinkling of an eye!"

No sooner had this one - who had the knowledge of the Book - finished his phrase than the throne stood before Solomon. The mission had, indeed, been completed in the blinking of an eye. Solomon's seat was in Palestine, and the throne of Bilqis had been in Yemen, two thousand miles away. This was a great miracle performed by one of those sitting with Solomon.

    He said: "0 chiefs! Which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me surrendering themselves in obedience?"

    An Ifrit (strong) from the jinns said: "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place (council). And verily, I am in deed strong, and trustworthy for such work."

    One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: "I will bring it to you within the twinkling of an eye!" - then when (Solomon) saw it placed before him, he said: 'This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful! And whoever is grateful, truly, his gratitude is for (the good of) his ownself and whoever is ungrateful, (he is ungrateful only for the loss of his ownself). Certainly! My Lord is Rich (Free of all wants), Bountiful."

    He said: "Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will be guided (to recognize her throne), or she will be one of those not guided."

    So when she came, it was said (to her): "Is your throne like this?"

    She said: "(It is) as though it was the very same."

    And (Solomon said): 'Knowledge was bestowed on us before her, and we were submitted to Allah (in Islam as Muslims before her)."

    And that which she used to worship besides Allah has prevented her (from Islam), for she was of a disbelieving people.

    It was said to her: "Enter As-Sarh "(a glass surface with water underneath it) or a palace, but when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she (tucked up her clothes) uncovering her legs.

    Solomon said: "Verily, it is Sarh paved smooth with slab of glass."

    She said: 'My Lord! Verily, I have wronged myself and I submit (in Islam), together with Solomon, to Allah, the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinns, and all that exists)." 
    Quran Ayah 27:38-441

During Bilqis' travel, Solomon asks his servants to deliver her throne to his court. An ifrit offers his service (Q27:38-40), but Solomon declines. Another man is endowed with this task instead, who prays to God for the throne. Afterwards, the prayer is answered and the throne appears thanks to God's power in Solomon's palace. When Bilqis arrives, Solomon asks if she can recognize her throne. She gives him an evasive answer, because she can not grasp the miracle performed here. Since this miracle was done by God (and not by the ifrit), she surrenders to the faith of Solomon. Solomon declined the ifrit's temptatious offer, because he wants to rely on God only and not on the demonic, this leading to his successful conversation of Bilqis.

### Solomon and horses 🐎🐎🐎

During his time horses were the common mode of transportation. They were very essential for defense, to carry soldiers and cart provisions and weapons of war. The animals were well cared for and well trained. One day Solomon was reviewing a parade of his stable. The fitness, beauty and posture of the horses fascinated him so much that he kept on stroking and admiring them. The sun was nearly setting, and the time for the middle prayer was passing by. When he realized this, he exclaimed: "I surely love the finer things of life than the service of my Lord! Return them to me."

    Almighty Allah revealed: And to David We gave Solomon. How excellent a slave! Verily, he was ever oft-returning in repentance (to Us)!

    When there were displayed before him, in the afternoon, well trained horses of the highest breed (for jihad in Allah's cause). And he said: 'Alas! I did love the good (these horses) instead of remembering my Lord (in my Asr prayer)" till the time was over, and (the sun) had hidden in the veil (of night). Then he said: "Bring them (horses) back to me." Then he began to pass his hand over their legs and their necks till the end of the display.

    And, indeed We did try Solomon and We placed on his throne Jasadan (a devil, so he lost his kingdom for a while) but he did return (to his throne and kingdom by the Grace of Allah and he did return) to Allah with obedience and in repentance. He said: 'My Lord.' Forgive me, and bestow upon me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me: verily, You are the Bestower."

    So, We subjected to him the wind, it blew gently to his order whither-so-ever he willed - and also the devils from the jinns (including) every kind of builder and diver, - and also others bound in fetters. (Saying of Allah to Solomon): 'This is Our gift, so spend you or withhold, no account will be asked." And verily, he enjoyed a near access to Us, and a good final return (Paradise). 
    Quran Ayah 38:30-40

### Death

The Quran relates that Solomon died while he was leaning on his staff. Then a creature (an ant or a worm) gnaw at Solomon's staff, until his body collapsed.

    Allah the Exalted revealed: And We caused a fount of (molten) brass to flow for him, and there were jinns that worked in front of him by the Leave of his Lord, and whosoever of them turned aside from Our Command, We shall cause him to taste of the torment of the blazing Fire. They worked for him what he desired, (making) high rooms, images, basins as large as reservoirs, and (making) cauldrons fixed (in their places). 'Work you, 0 family of David, with thanks!" But few of My slaves are grateful.

    Then, when We decreed (Solomon's) death, nothing showed them his death except a little worm of the earth, which kept (slowly) gnawing away at his staff: so when he fell down, the Jinn saw plainly that if they had known the unseen, they would not have tarried in the humiliating Penalty (of their Task).
    Qurʾan, Surah 34 (Sabaʾ), Ayah 12-14

As he remained upright, propped on his staff, the jinn thought he was still alive and supervising them.

The jinn realized the truth only when God sent a creature to crawl out of the ground and gnaw at Solomon's staff, until his body collapsed. This verse is understood to teach the audience that jinn do not know the unseen (Al-Ghaib), since if they had known the unseen, they would not have stayed in the service of Solomon.

## Ezekiel

</summary>

Almighty Allah said: 
    
    Did you (0 Muhammad) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them, 'Die." And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most men thank not. 
    Quran Ayah 2:243

Mohammad Ibn Ishaaq stated of Wahb Ibn Munbah said that
> when Allah took Kalih Ibn Yofra (Jephtha) after Joshua, Ezekiel Ibn Buzi succeeded him as the prophet to the Israelites. The people had fled from Palestine for fear of the plague and settled on a plateau. Allah said to them: "Die you all," and they all perished. A few centuries passed, and then Ezekiel, passing by, stopped over them, wondering. There came a voice: Do you want Allah to resurrect them while you watch?" He said: "Yes." Then he was commanded to call those bones to join one to the other and to be covered with flesh. So he called them by the power of Allah, and the people arose and glorified Allah in the voice of one man.

According to Ibn 'Abbas, this place was called "Damardan." Its people were inflicted with plague, so they fled, while a group of them who remained in the village perished. The Angel of Death called to the survivors: "Die you all," and they perished. After a long time a prophet called Ezekiel passed by them and stood wondering over them, twisting his jaws and fingers. Allah revealed to him: "Do you want Me to show you how I bring them back to life?" He said: 'Yes." His idea was to marvel at the power of Allah over them. A voice said to him: "Call: '0 you bones, Allah commands you to gather up."' The bones began to fly one to the other until they became skeletons. Then Allah revealed to him to say:

> "Call: '0 you bones, Allah commands you to put on flesh and blood and the clothes in which they had died."' And a voice said: "Allah commands you to call the bodies to rise." And they rose. When they returned to life they said: "Blessed are You, 0 Lord, and all praise is Yours." 

Ibn 'Abbas reported that the dead who were resurrected were four thousand, while Ibn Salih said they were nine thousand.

Muhammad Ibn Ishaaq stated that we do not know how long Ezekiel stayed among the Israelites before Allah took him away. After him, the Israelites deviated from the right way of life, as they usually did, and deserted Allah's covenant with them. They worshiped many idols, among them Ba'al, so Allah sent to them the Prophet Elijah.

## Ilyas (Elijah)

</summary>

Ilyas is mentioned 4 times in the Quran. He was the one who perfected his character.

After death of the prophet Suleyman as, his kingdom was divided into two: Israel (Samaria) and Judah (Jerusalem). They started to go astray. Allah sent Ilyas to Samaria because they started worshipping an idol. They did not listen to Ilyas, so Allah sent a long-lasting draught. Ilyas challenged priests of the idol Ball.

Ilyas is first mentioned as a prophet in Al-An'am 6:85. He invited his people who lived in Baalbek to monotheism, obeying God and abandoning sins. His main task was to prevent the idol-worshipping. After he faced persistence of his people for many years, cursed them with drought and people were inflicted with starvation. Ilyas' narrative in the Quran and later Muslim tradition resembles closely that in the Hebrew Bible and Muslim literature records Elijah's primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of Ahab and Jezebel as well as Ahaziah.

### Ilyas in the Quran

Ilyas is mentioned in the Quran, where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. The Quran narrates that Ilyas told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of Baal, the primary idol of the area. The Quran states:

    Verily Ilyas was one of the apostles. When he said to his people: "Will you not fear God? Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your Lord and Cherisher and the Lord and Cherisher of your fathers of old?"
    As-Saaffat 123–126

The Quran makes it clear that the majority of Ilyas' people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. However, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of God among them followed Elijah and believed in and worshiped God. The Quran states, `They denied him (Elijah), and will surely be brought to punishment, Except the sincere and devoted Servants of God (among them). And We left his (memory) for posterity.`

In the Quran, God praises Elijah in two places:

    Peace be upon Elijah! This is how We reward those who do good. He is truly among our believing servants.
    Quran, chapter 37 (As-Saaffat), verse 129–132

    And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas, they were all from among the righteous.
    Quran, chapter 6 (Al-An'am), verse 85

Numerous commentators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, have offered commentary on verse 85 saying that Ilyas, Zakariya, Yahya and Isa were all spiritually connected. Abdullah Yusuf Ali says, "The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: "the Righteous." They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as "Ilyas, which was for to come" (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3)."

### Legacy

Muslim literature and tradition recounts that Ilyas preached to the Kingdom of Israel, ruled over by Ahab and later his son Ahaziah. He is called a "prophet of the desert—like Yahya". Ilyas is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of God to Israel after him.

Ilyas has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr.

## Alyasa (Elisha)

</summary>

Alyasa is a prophet and messenger of God (Allah) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel. In the Quran, Alyasa is mentioned twice as a prophet, and is mentioned both times alongside fellow prophets. He is honored by Muslims as the prophetic successor to Ilyas (Elijah).

The name of Alyasa is mentioned twice in Al-An'am 6:86 and Sad 38:48. In those verses, without mentioning anything about the personality or prophethood of Alyasa, he is mentioned as "graced" and "among the elect". According to the Quran, Elisha is exalted "above the rest of creation" (Arabic: "among the excellent". Alyasa is mentioned along with Ismail:

    And Ismail and Alyasa and Yunus, and Lut; and each one We graced over the worlds;
    Quran Al-An'am 6:86

    And remember Our servants Ismail, Alyasa, and Dhul-Kifl, each of them truly good.
    Quran Sad 38:48

### Elisha in the New Testament

Elisha is venerated as a prophet in Judaism, Christianity and Islam and writings of the Baháʼí Faith refer to him by name.

In the biblical narrative he is a disciple and protégé of Elijah, and after Elijah was taken up in a whirlwind, he gave Elisha a double portion of his power and he was accepted as the leader of the sons of the prophets. Elisha then went on to perform twice as many miracles as Elijah.

## Yunus (Jonah) and The Big Fish 🐳

</summary>

> ~ VIII-IX century BCE

Yunus is called in the Quran as a companion of the fish 🐟. He was in three darknesses: the darkness of the night, darkness of the ocean's depth, darkness of the whale's stomach.

Yunus ibn Matta (يُونُس ابن ماتا, ) is a prophet and messenger of God (Allah). Yunus is traditionally viewed as highly important in Islam as a prophet who was faithful to God and delivered His messages. Yunus is the only one of the Bible's Twelve Minor Prophets to be named in the Quran. The tenth chapter of the Quran is named after him.

In the Quran, Yunus is mentioned several times by name, as an apostle of Allah, and as Dhul-Nun ( ذُو ٱلنُّوْن)).

In Al-Anbiya 21:87 and Al-Qalam 68:48, Yunus is called Dhul-Nūn (ذُو ٱلنُّوْن, lit. 'The One of the Fish'). In An-Nisa 4:163 and Al-An'am 6:86, he is referred to as "an apostle of Allah". 

The Quran does not mention Yunus' heritage, but Muslim tradition teaches that Yunus was from the tribe of Benjamin.

The inhabitants of the town of Nineveh were idolators who lived a shameless life. Prophet Jonah was sent to teach them the worship of Allah. The people disliked his interference in their way of worship, so they argued: "We and our forefathers have worshipped these gods for many years and no harm has come to us."

Try as he might to convince them of the foolishness of idolatry and of the goodness of Allah's laws, they ignored him. He warned them that if they kept on with their foolishness, Allah's punishment would soon follow. Instead of fearing Allah, they told Jonah that they were not afraid of his threats. "Let it happen," they told him. Jonah was disheartened. "In that case I will leave you to your misery!" So saying, he left Nineveh, fearing that Allah's anger would soon follow. 

    And (remember) Dhan-Nun (Jonah), when he went off in anger, and imagined that We shall not punish him (i.e., the calamities which had befallen him)! 
    Surah 21:87

### People of Yunus repent

Hardly had Yunus left the city when the skies began to change color and looked as if they were on fire. The people were filled with fear by this sight. They recalled the destruction of the people of 'Ad, Thamud and Noah. Was theirs to be a similar fate? Slowly faith penetrated their hearts. They all gathered on the mountain and started to beseech Allah for His mercy and forgiveness. The mountains echoed with their cries. It was a momentous hour, filled with sincere repentance.

Allah removed His wrath and showered His blessings upon them once again. When the threatening storm was lifted, they prayed for the return of Yunus so that he could guide them.

### Yunus in a storm

Meanwhile, Jonah had boarded a small ship in the company of other passengers. It sailed all day in calm waters with a good wind blowing at the sails. When night came, the sea suddenly changed. A horrible storm blew as if it were going to split the ship into pieces. The waves looked wild. They rose up as high as mountains then plunged down like valleys, tossing the ship and sweeping over the deck.

Behind the ship, a large whale was splitting the water and opening its mouth. A command had been issued from Almighty Allah to one of the greatest whales of the sea to surface. It obeyed. The whale hurried to the surface of the sea and followed the ship as it had been commanded.

The tempest continued and the chief crewman asked the crew to lighten the ship's heavy load. They threw their baggage overboard, but this was not enough. Their safety lay in reducing the weight further, so they decided among themselves to lighten their load by removing at least one person.

### Yunus jumps into the sea

The captain directed: "We will make lots with all the travelers' names. The one whose name is drawn will be thrown into the sea." Jonah knew this was one of the seamen's traditions when facing a tempest. It was a strange polytheistic tradition, but it was practiced at that time. Jonah's affliction and crisis began.

Here was the prophet, subjected to polytheistic rules that considered the sea and the wind to have gods that riot. The captain had to please these gods. Jonah reluctantly participated in the lot, and his name was added to the other travelers' names. The lot was drawn and "Jonah" appeared.

Since they knew him to be the most honorable among them, they did not wish to throw him into the angry sea. Therefore, they decided to draw a second lot. Again Jonah's name was drawn. They gave him a final chance and drew a third lot. Unfortunately for Jonah, his name came up again.

Jonah realized that Allah's hand was in all this, for he had abandoned his mission without Allah's consent. The matter was over, and it was decided that Jonah should throw himself into the water. Jonah stood at the edge of the ship, looking at the furious sea. It was night and there was no moon. The stars were hidden behind a black fog. But before he could be thrown overboard, Jonah kept mentioning Allah's name as he jumped into the raging sea and disappeared beneath the huge waves.

### A whale swallows Yunus

The whale found Yunus floating on the waves before it. It swallowed Yunus into its furious stomach and shut its ivory teeth on him as if they were white bolts locking the door of his prison. The whale dived to the bottom of the sea, the sea that runs in the abyss of darkness.

Three layers of darkness enveloped him, one above the other: the darkness of the whale's stomach, the darkness of the bottom of the sea, the darkness of the night. Jonah imagined himself to be dead, but his senses became alert when he found he could move. He knew that he was alive and imprisoned in the midst of three layers of darkness. His heart was moved by remembering Allah. His tongue was released soon after saying: "La ilaha illa Anta (none has the right to be worshipped but You (0, Allah), Glorified (and Exalted) be You above all that (evil) they associate with You. Truly, I have been of the wrong-doers." 

    And ˹remember˺ when the Man of the Whale stormed off ˹from his city˺ in a rage, thinking We would not restrain him. Then in the ˹veils of˺ darkness he cried out, “There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except You. Glory be to You! I have certainly done wrong.”
    Surah 21:87

Jonah continued praying to Allah, repeating this invocation. Fishes, whales, sea-weeds, and all the creatures that lived in the sea heard the voice of Jonah praying, heard the celebration of Allah's praises issuing from the whale's stomach. All these creatures gathered around the whale and began to celebrate the praises of Allah in their turn, each in its own way and in its own language.

### Allah forgives Yunus

The whale also participated in celebrating the praises of Allah and understood that it had swallowed a prophet. Therefore it felt afraid; however, it said to itself: "Why should I be afraid? Allah commanded me to swallow him."

Allah Almighty saw the sincere repentance of Jonah and heard his invocation in the whale's stomach. Allah commanded the whale to surface and eject Jonah onto an island. The whale obeyed and swam to the farthest side of the ocean. Allah commanded it to rise towards the warm, refreshing sun and the pleasant earth.

The whale ejected Jonah onto a remote island. His body was inflamed because of the acids inside the whale's stomach. He was ill, and when the sun rose, its rays burned his inflamed body so that he was on the verge of screaming for the pain. However, he endured the pain and continued to repeat his invocation to Allah.

Almighty Allah caused a vine to grow to considerable length over him for protection. Then Allah Exalted caused Jonah to recover and forgave him. Allah told Jonah that if it had not been for his praying to Him, he would have stayed in the whale's stomach till the Day of Judgment.

Gradually he regained his strength and found his way to his hometown, Nineveh. He was pleasantly surprised to notice the change that had taken place there. The entire population turned out to welcome him. They informed him that they had turned to believe in Allah. Together they led a prayer of thanksgiving to their Merciful Lord.

Surah 37:139-148 retells the full story of Yunus:

    So also was Yunus among those sent (by Us).
    When he ran away (like a slave from captivity) to the ship (fully) laden,
    He (agreed to) cast lots, and he was condemned.

    Then the whale did swallow him, and he had done acts worthy of blame.
    Had it not been that he (repented and) glorified Allah,
    He would certainly have remained inside the Fish till the Day of Resurrection.

    But We cast him forth on the naked shore in a state of sickness,
    And We caused to grow, over him, a spreading plant of the gourd kind.

    And We sent him (on a mission) to a hundred thousand (men) or more.
    And they believed; so We permitted them to enjoy (their life) for a while.
    Quran, chapter 37 (As-Saaffat), verses 139–148

### Hadithic mentions

Yunus is also mentioned in a few incidents during the lifetime of Muhammad. In some instances, Yunus' name is spoken of with praise and reverence by Muhammad. According to historical narrations about Muhammad's life, after ten years of receiving revelations, Muhammad went to the city of Ta’if to see if its leaders would allow him to preach his message from there rather than Mecca, but he was cast from the city by the people. He took shelter in the garden of Utbah and Shaybah, two members of the Quraysh tribe. They sent their servant, Addas, to serve him grapes for sustenance. Muhammad asked Addas where he was from and the servant replied Nineveh. "The town of Yunus the just, son of Amittai!" Muhammad exclaimed. Addas was shocked because he knew that the pagan Arabs had no knowledge of the prophet Yunus. He then asked how Muhammad knew of this man. "We are brothers," Muhammad replied. "Yunus was a Prophet of God and I, too, am a Prophet of God." Addas immediately accepted Islam and kissed the hands and feet of Muhammad.

One of the sayings of Muhammad, in the collection of Imam Bukhari, says that Muhammad said "One should not say that I am better than Yunus". Ibn Abi al-Salt, an older contemporary of Muhammad, taught that, had Yunus not prayed to Allah, he would have remained trapped inside the fish until Day of Resurrection but, because of his prayer, Yunus "stayed only a few days within the belly of the fish".

The ninth-century Persian historian Al-Tabari records that, while Jonah was inside the fish, "none of his bones or members were injured". Al-Tabari also writes that Allah made the body of the fish transparent, allowing Yunus to see the "wonders of the deep" and that Yunus heard all the fish singing praises to Allah. Kisai Marvazi, a tenth-century poet, records that Yunus' father was seventy years old when Yunus was born and that he died soon afterwards, leaving Yunus' mother with nothing but a wooden spoon, which turned out to be a cornucopia.

## Dhu al-Kifl

</summary>

Dhu al-Kifl ( ذُو ٱلْكِفْل, ḏū ʾl-kīfl, literally "Possessor of the Kifl "; also spelled Dhu l-Kifl, Dhul-Kifl, Zu al-Kifl, or Zu l-Kifl) is an Islamic prophet. Although his identity is unknown, his identity has been theorised and identified as various Hebrew Bible prophets and other figures, most commonly Ezekiel and Gautama Buddha. Dhu al-Kifl is believed to have been exalted by Allah to a high station in life and is chronicled in the Quran as a man of the "Company of the Good". Although not much is known of Dhu al-Kifl from other historical sources, all the writings from classical commentators, such as Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Kathir, speak of Dhu al-Kifl as a prophetic, saintly man who remained faithful in daily prayer and worship.

Dhu al-Kifl has been mentioned twice in the Quran, in the following verses:

    And (remember) Isma'il, Idris, and Dhu al-Kifl, all (men) of constancy and patience.
    We admitted them to Our mercy: for they were of the righteous ones.
    Quran, Surah Al-Anbiya (21), Ayahs 85–86

    And commemorate Isma'il, Elisha and Dhu al-Kifl: Each of them was of the Company of the Good.
    Quran, Surah Sad (38), Ayah 48

In both cases, Dhu al-Kifl is mentioned in the context of a list of Qur'anic prophets, including many others not mentioned in the ayat quoted above.

## Uzair

</summary>

Uzair (عزير, ʿUzayr) is a figure who is mentioned in the Quran, Surah At-Tawba, verse 9:30, which states that he was revered by the Jews as "the son of God". Uzair is most often identified with the biblical Ezra. Modern historians have described the reference as "enigmatic", since such views have not been found in Jewish sources. Islamic scholars have interpreted the Quranic reference in different ways, with some explaining that it alluded to a specific group of Jews.

According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived between the times of King Solomon and the time of Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic commentators viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr to be one of the prophets.

The Jews call Uzair a son of Allah, and the Christians call the Christ a son of Allah. That is a saying from their mouth; (in this) they but imitate what the unbelievers of old used to say. May Allah destroy them: how they are deluded away from the Truth!(Quran 9:30)

In February 624, when the qibla (direction of prayer) changed from Jerusalem to Mecca. Sallam ibn Mishkam, a Jew who lived in Medina and his friends asked Muhammad: “How can we follow you when you have abandoned our qibla and you do not allege that Uzair (Ezra) is the son of God?”: 269  This verse is situated in a context of theological disputes with the Jewish community of Medina. The Quran emphasizes the absolute divinity of God and warns against associating any being with him (shirk). It further condemns Jewish and Christian leaders of the time for deceiving the masses into taking "their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of God". In casting doubt on claims about the divine status of Uzayr and Christ, the Quran also instructs Muslims to reject such beliefs. These arguments reflect the tensions between the new Muslim community and the more established Christian and Jewish communities of Arabia.

In some Islamic texts, Ezra is identified as the person mentioned in Qur'an 2:259

    Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: "Oh! how shall God bring it (ever) to life, after (this) its death?" but God caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again). He said: "How long didst thou tarry (thus)?" He said: (Perhaps) a day or part of a day." He said: "Nay, thou hast tarried thus a hundred years; but look at thy food and thy drink; they show no signs of age; and look at thy donkey: And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people, Look further at the bones, how We bring them together and clothe them with flesh." When this was shown clearly to him, he said: "I know that God hath power over all things." (Quran 2:259)

According to the classical Quranic exegete, Ibn Kathir, after Ezra questioned how the resurrection will take place on the Day of judgment, God had him brought back to life many years after he died. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. Ezra then led the people to locate the only surviving copy of Torah as the remaining were burnt by Nebuchadnezzar. It was rotting and crumpled, so Ezra had a new copy of the Torah made which he had previously memorized. He thus renovated the Torah to the Children of Israel. Ibn Kathir mentions that the sign in the phrase "And that We may make of thee a sign unto the people" was that he was younger than his children. After this miracle, Ibn Kathir writes that Jews began to claim that Ezra was the 'son of God'.

The modern Quranic exegesis of Abul Ala Maududi states:

Uzair (Ezra) lived during the period around 450 B.C. The Jews regarded him with great reverence as the revivalist of their Scriptures which had been lost during their captivity in Babylon after the death of Prophet Solomon. So much so that they had lost all the knowledge of their Law, their traditions and of Hebrew, their national language. Then it was Ezra who re-wrote the Old Testament and revived the Law. That is why they used very exaggerated language in his reverence which misled some of the Jewish sects to make him 'the son of God'. The Qur'an, however, does not assert that all the Jews were unanimous in declaring Ezra as 'the son of God'. What it intends to say is that the perversion in the articles of faith of the Jews concerning Allah had degenerated to such an extent that there were some amongst them who considered Ezra as the son of God.

According to Maulana Muhammad Ali's Quranic commentary, there indeed existed a group of Jews who venerated Ezra as the son of God. According to Ali, Qastallani held that in the Kitan al-Nikah, that there was a party of Jews who held this belief.

# 7. Isa (Jesus and Family of Imran)
*******************************************

<details><summary>

## Maryam (Virgin Mary) is born

</summary>

### Wife of Imran (Joahim) makes dua

The Family of Imran) is the third chapter (sūrah) of the Quran with two hundred verses (āyāt).

Imran in Islam is regarded as the father of Mary. This chapter is named after the family of Imran, which includes Imran, Saint Anne (wife of Imran), Mary, and Jesus.

His wife thought that he was going to give birth to a boy, but it was Mary.

### Birth of Mary

Maryam (مريم بنت عمران, Maryam bint Imran), daughter of Imran, mother of Isa (Jesus), holds a singularly exalted place in Islam as the only woman named in the Quran, which refers to her seventy times and explicitly identifies her as the greatest of all women, stating, with reference to the angelic salutation during the annunciation, `O Mary, God has chosen you, and purified you; He has chosen you above all the women of creation.` In the Quran, her story is related in three Meccan chapters (19, 21, 23) and four Medinan surahs (3, 4, 5, 66), and the nineteenth Surah titled Maryam, is named after her. The Quran refers to Mary more often than the Bible.

According to the Quran, divine grace surrounded Mary from birth, and, as a young woman, she received a message from God through the archangel Gabriel that God had chosen her, purified her, and had preferred her above all "the women of the worlds." This event, according to the same narrative, was followed by the annunciation of a child who was to be miraculously conceived by her through the intervention of the divine spirit while she was still virgin, whose name would be Jesus and who would be the "anointed one," the Promised Messiah.

The birth of Mary is narrated in the Quran with references to her father as well as her mother. Mary's father is called Imran. He is the equivalent of Joachim in Christian tradition. Her mother, according to al-Tabari, is called Hannah, which is the same name as in Christian tradition (Saint Anne). Muslim literature narrates that Imran and his wife were old and childless and that, one day, the sight of a bird 🐦 in a tree feeding her young aroused Anne's desire for a child. She prayed to God to fulfill her desire and vowed, if her prayer was accepted, that her child would be dedicated to the service of God.

Hannah thought that she would conceive a boy. When she delivered Mary, she said `Oh my Lord! Verily I have delivered a female, and the male is not like the female, for a girl will not be a prophet` to which Allah replies `And God knows better what has been delivered`.

### Early years

The Quran does not, specifically, point to the fact that Mary lived and grew up in a temple as the word miḥ'rāb in Quran 3:36 in its literal meaning refers to a private chamber or a public/private prayer chamber. The definitive idea of Mary growing up in a temple derived via external literature (i.e. see the narration below by Ja'far al-Sadiq). She was placed under the care of the prophet Zechariah, the husband of Hannah's sister and Mary's maternal uncle and caretaker. As often as Zechariah entered Mary's prayer chamber, he found her provided with food and he would ask her where she received it from, to which she would reply that God provides to whom He wills. Scholars have debated as to whether this refers to miraculous food that Mary received from God or whether it was normal food. Those in favor of the former view state that it had to be miraculous food, as Zechariah being a prophet, would have known that God is the provider of all sustenance and thus would not have questioned Mary, if it was normal food.

Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq narrates that when Maryam was grown, she would go into the mihrab and put on a covering so no one saw her. Zechariah went into the mihrab and found that she had summer fruit in the winter and winter fruit in the summer. `He asked "From whence is this?" She said, "It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account".`

## Zakariyah

</summary>

Zakariya was a righteous priest and prophet of God whose office was in the Second Temple in Jerusalem. He would frequently be in charge of managing the services of the temple and he would always remain steadfast in prayer to God.

### Praying for a son

As he reached his old age, Zakariya began to worry over who would continue the legacy of preaching the message of God after his death and who would carry on the daily services of the temple after him. Zakariya started to pray to God for a son. The praying for the birth of an offspring was not merely out of the desire for a child. He prayed both for himself and for the public – they needed a messenger, a man of God who would work in the service of the Lord after Zakariya. Zakariya had character and virtue and he wanted to transfer this to his spiritual heir as his most precious possession. His dream was to restore the household to the posterity of the Patriarch Jacob, and to make sure the message of God was renewed for Israel. As the Qur'an recounts:

    A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zakariya. When he cried unto his Lord a cry in secret, saying: My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey hair, and I have never been unblest in prayer to Thee, my Lord. Lo! I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren. Oh, give me from Thy presence a successor who shall inherit of me and inherit (also) of the house of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, acceptable (unto Thee). 
    Quran 19:4–6

### Fathering Yahya

As a gift from God, Zakariya was given a son named Yaḥyá (يحيى, identified with John the Baptist), a name specially chosen for this child alone. Muslim tradition narrates that Zakariya was ninety-two years old when he was told of John's birth.

In accordance with Zakariya's prayer, God made John (Yahya) renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and lost by the Israelites. As the Qur'an says:

    O Zachariah! Lo! We bring thee tidings of a son whose name is John; we have given the same name to none before (him). He said: My Lord! How can I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached infirm old age? He said: So shall it be, your Lord says: It is easy to Me, and indeed I created you before, when you were nothing. He said: My Lord! give me a sign. He said: Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to the people three nights while in sound health.
    Quran 19:7–10

### Guardian of Maryam

According to the Qur'an, Zakariya was the guardian of Maryam. The Qur'an states:

    (Remember) when the wife of 'Imran said: My Lord! I have vowed unto Thee that which is in my belly as a consecrated (offering). Accept it from me. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower! And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast. And her Lord accepted her with full acceptance and vouchsafed to her a goodly growth; and made Zachariah her guardian. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary where she was, he found that she had food. He said: O Mary! Whence cometh unto thee this (food)? She answered: It is from Allah. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will.
    Quran 3:35–37

The fact that, of all the priests, it was Zakariya who was given the duty of keeping care of Mary (Maryam) shows his status as a pious man. Zakariya is frequently praised in the Qur'an as a prophet of God and righteous man. One such appraisal is in sura al-An'am:

    "And Zakariya and Yahya and Isa and Eliyas. Each one was of the righteous."
    Quran 6:85

## Virgin Mary gives birth to Jesus

</summary>

The virgin birth of Jesus is important in Islam as one of miracles of God. The first explicit mention of an annunciation foreshadowing the birth of Jesus is in Quran 19:20 where Mary asks Gabriel (Jibril) how she will be able to conceive, when no man has touched her. Gabriel's reply assures Mary that for God all things are easy and that Jesus's virgin birth will be a sign for mankind. The birth is later referred in Quran 66:12, where the Quran states that Mary remained "pure", while God allowed a life to shape itself in Mary's womb. A third mention of the annunciation is in Q3:42–43, where Mary is also given the glad tidings that she has been chosen above all the women of creation.

Commentators on the Quran remark on the last verse that Mary was as close to a perfect woman as there could be, and she was devoid of almost all failings. Although Islam honors numerous women, including Zipporah, Hajar, Sarah, Asiya, Khadijah, Fatimah, Aisha, Hafsa, many commentators followed this verse in the absolute sense, and agreed that Mary was the greatest woman of all time. 

According to exegesis and literature, Gabriel appeared to Mary, who was still young in age, in the form of a well-made man with a "shining face" and announced to her the birth of Jesus. After her immediate astonishment, she was reassured by the angel's answer that God has the power to do anything. The details of the conception are not discussed during these angelic visits, but elsewhere the Quran states (Quran 21:91) and 66:12) that God breathed "His Spirit" into Mary while she was chaste.

According to the Quran, Mary was chosen twice by the Lord. `"O Mary! Verily Allah has chosen you and puriﬁed you and chosen you above the women of the worlds" (Quran 3:42)`; and the first choosing was her selection with glad tidings given to Imran. The second was that she became pregnant without a man, so in this regard, she was chosen over all other women in the world.

The Quran narrates the virgin birth of Jesus numerous times. In chapter 19 (Maryam), verses (ayat) 17–21, the annunciation is given, followed by the virgin birth in due course. Quran 3:47 also supports the virginity of Mary, revealing that `"no man has touched [her]"`.

According to the Quran, the following conversation transpired between the angel Gabriel and Mary when he appeared to her in the form of a man:

    And mention, [O Muhammad], in the Book [the story of] Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place toward the east. And she took, in seclusion from them, a screen. Then We sent to her Our spirit, and he represented himself to her as a well-proportioned man. She said, "Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, [so leave me], if you should be fearing of Allah." 

    He said, "I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you a pure boy." She said, "How can I have a boy while no man has touched me and I have not been unchaste?" He said, "Thus [it will be]; your Lord says, 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us. And it is a matter [already] decreed.'
    Quran 19:16-21

The Quran's narrative of the virgin birth is somewhat different from that in the New Testament. The Quran states that when the pains of childbirth came upon Mary, she held onto a nearby palm tree 🌴, at which point a voice came from "beneath the (palm-tree)" or "beneath her", which said " `"Grieve not! for thy Lord hath provided a rivulet beneath thee; "And shake towards thyself the trunk of the palm-tree: It will let fall fresh ripe dates upon thee."` The Quran goes on to describe that Mary vowed not to speak to any man on that day, as God was to make Jesus, who Muslims believe spoke in the cradle, perform his first miracle. The Quran goes on to narrate that Mary then brought Jesus to the temple, where immediately she began to be taunted by all the men, excluding Zechariah, who believed in the virgin birth. The Israelites questioned Mary how she came to be with child whilst unmarried, to which Mary pointed to the baby Jesus. It was then that, according to the Quran, the infant Jesus began to speak in the cradle, and spoke of his prophecy for the first time.

## Yahya ibn Zakarīyā (John the Baptist)

</summary>
> I century BC

Yahya ibn Zakariya (John, son of Zechariah), identified in English as John the Baptist, is considered in Islam a prophet and messenger of God (Allah) who was sent to guide the Children of Israel. He is believed by Muslims to have been a witness to the word of God who would herald the coming of Isa Masih (Jesus).

Yahya is mentioned five times in the Quran.

Yahya is also honored highly in Sufism as well as Islamic mysticism, primarily because of the Quran's description of John's chastity and kindness. Sufis have frequently applied commentaries on the passages on John in the Quran, primarily concerning the God-given gift of wisdom which he acquired in youth as well as his parallels with Jesus. Although several phrases used to describe John and Jesus are virtually identical in the Quran, the manner in which they are expressed is different.

In the Quran, God frequently mentions Zakariya's continuous praying for the birth of a son. Zakariya's wife, was barren and therefore the birth of a child seemed impossible. As a gift from God, Zechariah was given a son by the name of Yaḥya, a name specially chosen for this child alone. In accordance with Zakariya's prayer, God made Yahya and Isa, who according to exegesis was born six months later, to renew the message of God, which had been corrupted and distorted by the Israelites.

The Quran claims that Yahya was the first to receive this name (Quran 19:7–10) but since the name Yoḥanan occurs many times before John the Baptist,this verse is referring either to Islamic scholar consensus that "Yaḥyā" is not the same name as "Yoḥanan" or to the Biblical account of the miraculous naming of John, which accounted that he was almost named "Zacharias" (Greek: Ζαχαρίας) after his father's name, as no one in the lineage of his father Zacharias (also known as Zechariah) had been named "John" ("Yohanan"/"Yoannes") before him. As the Quran says:

    "O Zakaryya, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be Yahya, and whose we never before have created sameness for.
    He said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son, when my wife is barren and I have grown quite decrepit from old age?"
    He said: "So (it will be) thy Lord saith, 'that is easy for Me: I did indeed create thee before, when thou hadst been nothing!'"

    (Zakarya) said: "O my Lord! give me a Sign." "Thy Sign," was the answer, "Shall be that thou shalt speak to no man for three nights."
    Quran, surah Maryam 19: 7–10

### Prophethood

Yahya was exhorted to hold fast to the scripture and was given wisdom by God while still a child. He was pure and devout, and walked well in the presence of God. He was dutiful towards his parents and he was not arrogant or rebellious. John's reading and understanding of the scriptures, when only a child, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time. Muslim exegesis narrates that Isa sent Yahya out with twelve disciples, who preached the message before Jesus called his own disciples. The Quran says:

    "O Yaḥya! take hold of the Book with might": and We gave him Wisdom even as a youth,
    Quran, surah Maryam, 19:12

Yahya was a classical prophet, who was exalted high by God for his bold denouncing of all things sinful. Furthermore, the Quran speaks of Yahya's gentle piety and love and his humble attitude towards life, for which he was granted the purity of Life.

According to Islamic tradition, Yahya used to go to the Haram esh-Sharif (Temple Mount) to deliver his sermons.

## Isa (Jesus of Nazareth)

</summary>

Isa ibn Maryam (عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ, lit. 'Jesus, son of Mary'), is the second-last prophet and messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah, who was sent to guide the Children of Israel with a revelation: Injīl (Arabic for "gospel").

> Isa (Jesus) has a very important role in Islam as a prophet and the Messiah, who is to return to earth before the Judgement Day to unite Muslims and defeat Dajjal (Antichrist). 
>
> As in the Christian New Testament, the Quran (the central religious text of Islam) describes Jesus as al-Masīḥ (Arabic for messiah), born of a virgin, performing miracles, accompanied by disciples, rejected by the Jewish establishment, and being raised to heaven. The Quran firmly states that Jesus is not divine and he is not the Son of God. Also, the Quran differs from the New Testament in proclaiming that Jesus was neither crucified nor died on the cross.
> 

The significance of Jesus in Islam is reflected in his being mentioned in the Quran in 93 verses with various titles attached such as `"Son of Mary"`, "`Spirit of God"`, and the `"Word of God"`, and other relational titles, mentioned directly and indirectly, over 187 times. Jesus is more briefly described in Surah Maryam, Chapter 19 of Quran. Thus, he is one of the most mentioned people in the Quran by reference; 25 times by the name Isa, third-person 48 times, first-person 35 times and the rest as titles.

The Quran and ahadith (testimonial reports) mention Jesus to have been born a "pure boy" (without sin) to Maryam (Mary) as the result of virginal conception, similar to the event of the Annunciation in Christianity. The Quran denies Jesus as a deity in several verses, including one that mentions that Jesus did not claim to be divine (Q5:116). According to the Quran, he was not crucified, but was rather saved by God. Muslims believe that Jesus did not die on the cross, but still believe that he was raised alive to heaven.

In Islam, Jesus is believed to have been the precursor to the Islamic prophet Muhammad  ﷺ  . According to the Quran, the coming of Muhammad ﷺ   was predicted by Jesus in As-Saff 61:6. Through this verse, early Arab Muslims claimed legitimacy for their new faith in the existing religious traditions and the alleged predictions of Jesus. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is also called a Muslim, as he preached that his followers should adopt the "straight path". In Islamic eschatology, Jesus will return in a Second Coming to fight Al-Masih ad-Dajjal or the "False Messiah" as well as Gog and Magog and establish peace and justice on earth.

It is generally agreed that Jesus spoke Aramaic, the common language of Judea in the first century A.D. and the region at-large.

### Birth narrative

According to the Quran, the pains of labor took Mary to the trunk of a palm tree 🌴.

The most detailed account of the annunciation and birth of Jesus is provided in Surah 3 (Al Imran) and 19 (Maryam) of the Quran where the story is narrated that God (Allah) sent an angel to announce that Maryam could shortly expect to bear a son, despite being a virgin.

Some scholars have noted that the account in Surah 19 is particularly close to that in the Christian Gospel of Luke. The Annunciation to Mary is mentioned twice in the Quran and in both instances Mary/Maryam is told that she was chosen by God to deliver a son. In the first instance, the bearer of the news (who is believed by most Muslims to be the archangel Gabriel), delivered the news in (Q3:42-47) as he takes the form of a man (Q19:16-22). The details of the conception are not discussed but when Mary asks how she can bear a son in view of her chastity she is told that God creates what he wills and that these things are easy for God. The Quran (Q21:91 and Q66:12) says that God blew through his angel into Mary and she, although being chaste, bore Jesus without any father.

The account of the birth of Jesus follows the Quran's narrative, adding that the birth occurred in Bethlehem beside a palm tree.

    "And we made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs." 

### Maryam and Isa return to the city 

    Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him. They said: "0 Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing Fariyya (an unheard mighty thing). 0 sister (i.e. the like) of Aaron (not the brother of Moses, but he was another pious man at the time of Mary)! Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor was your mother an unchaste woman."

    Then she pointed to him. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?"

    He (Jesus) said: "Verily! I am a slave of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet; And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me prayer, and Zakat, as long as Ilive, and dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest. And Salam (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!" Quran Ayah 19:27-33

### Speaking from the cradle

Speaking from the cradle is mentioned in three places in the Quran: al-Imran (3) 41, 46, al-Maida (5) 109–110 and Maryam (19) 29–30. Part of the narrative has the infant Jesus defending his mother Mary from the accusation of having given birth without a known husband. Jesus speaks as the angel Gabriel had mentioned at the annunciation: Jesus proclaims he is a servant of God, has been given a book, is a prophet, is blessed wherever he will go, blesses the day he was born, the day he will die, and the day he is raised alive.

### Quran says that God has no son

Almighty Allah refuted the claims of the Jews and the Christians in many verses of the Glorious Qur'an.

    And they say: 'The Most Beneficent (Allah) has begotten a son (or offspring or children) as the Jews say: Ezra is the son of Allah, and the Christians say that He has begotten a son (Christ), and the pagan Arabs say that He has begotten daughters (angels, etc.)."

    Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing Where by the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins, that they ascribe a son (or offspring or children) to the Most Beneficent (Allah).

    But it is not suitable for (the Majesty of) the Most Beneficent (Allah) that He should beget a son (or offspring or children). There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent (Allah) as a slave. Verily He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting And everyone of them will come to Him alone on the Day of Resurrection (without any helper, or protector or defender).
    Quran Ayah 19:88-95

    Almighty Allah commanded: 0 people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allah aught but the truth. The Messiah Jesus, son of Mary was (no more than) a Messenger of Allah and His Word, ("Be" - and he was) which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit (Ruh) created by Him; so believe in Allah and His Messengers. Say not: 'Three (trinity)!" Cease! (It is) better for you. For Allah is (the only) One Ilah (God), Glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs.
    Quran Ayah 4:171-173

### Quran disclaims Trinity

    Allah the Exalted warned: Surely they have disbelieved who say: 'Allah is the Messiah (Jesus), son of Mary." But the Messiah (Jesus) said: "O Children of Israel! Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Verily whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers.

    Surely disbelievers are those who said: 'Allah is the third of the three (in a Trinity)." But there is no Ilah (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilah (God- Allah). And if they cease not from what they say verily a painful torment will befall the disbelievers among them.

    Will they not repent to Allah and ask His Forgiveness? For Allah is Oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.

    The Messiah (Jesus), son of Mary, was no more than a Messenger; many were the Messengers that passed a way before him. His mother (Mary) was a Siddiqah i.e. she believed in the Words of Allah and His Books. They both used to eat food (as any other human being, while Allah does not eat). Look how We make the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) clear to them, yet look how they are deluded a way (from the truth). 
    Quran Ayah 6:72-75

### Miracles performed by Isa

The Quran attributes at least six miracles to Jesus.

These six miracles in the Quran are without detail unlike the Gospel and their non-canonical Gnostic sources, which include details and mention other attributed miracles.

    (Remember) when Allah will say (on the Day of Resurrection): 'O Jesus, son of Mary! Remember My Favor to you and to your mother when I supported you with Ruh-ul-Qudus (Gabriel) so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity and when I taught you writing Al-Hikmah (the power of understanding), the Torah and the Gospel; and when you made out of the clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, by My Permission, and you breathed into it, and it became a bird by My Permission, and you healed those born blind, and the lepers by My Permission, and when you brought forth the dead by My Permission; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you (when they resolved to kill you) since you came unto them with clear proofs, and the disbelievers among them said: 'This is nothing but evident magic.

    And when I (Allah) put in the hearts of the disciples (of Jesus) to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: "We believe. And bear witness that we are Muslims. " 
    Quran Ayah 5:110-111

#### Creating birds 🐦🐦 from clay

The miracle story of creating birds from clay and breathing life into them when a child is mentioned in al-Imran (3) 43, 49 and al-Maida (5) 109–110. Although this miracle is also not mentioned the canonical Gospel, the same narrative is found in at least two pre-Islamic sources: the Infancy Gospel of Thomas and the Jewish Toledot Yeshu, with few variant details between the Quran and these two sources.

#### Healing the blind and the lepers

Similar to the New Testament, the Quran mentions Jesus healing the blind and the lepers in al-Imran (3) 49. Muslim scholar and judge al-Baydawi (d. 1286) wrote how it was recorded that many thousands of people came to Jesus to be healed and that Jesus healed these diseases through prayer only. Medieval scholar al-Tha'labi wrote about how these two particular diseases were beyond medical help, and Jesus' miracles were meant to be witnessed by others as clear signs of his message.

### Raising the dead

Jesus is believed to have raised people from the dead, as mentioned in al-Imran (3) 49. Although no detail is given as to who was raised or the circumstance, at least three people are mentioned in detail in the Gospel (a daughter of Jairus, a widow's son at Nain, and Lazarus).

### Prescience
Jesus was able to predict, or had foreknowledge, of what was hidden or unknown to others. One example is Jesus would answer correctly any and every question anyone asked him. Another example is Jesus knew what people had just eaten, as well as what they had stored in their homes.

#### Table of food from heaven

In the fifth chapter of the Quran, al-Ma'ida (5) 112–115, a narration mentions the disciples of Jesus requesting a table laden with food, and for it to be a special day of commemoration for them in the future.

    Allah the Exalted said: (Remember) when the disciples said: "0 Jesus, son of Mary! Can your Lord send down to us a table spread (with food) from heaven?" Jesus said: "Fear Allah, if you are indeed believers." They said: "We wish to eat thereof and to be stronger in Faith, and to know that you have indeed told us the truth and that we ourselves be its witnesses."

    Jesus, son of Mary, said: "0 Allah, our Lord! Send us from heaven a table spread (with food) that there may be for us -- for the first and the last of us -- a festival and a sign from You; and provide us sustenance, for You are the Best of sustainers." Allah said: "I am going to send it down unto you, but if any of you after that disbelieves, then I will punish him with a torment such as I have not inflicted on anyone among (all) the Alamin (mankind and jinn)."
    Quran Ayah 5:112-116

In a record by the Sunni exegete Tabari, before the last supper, the threat of death made Isa anxious. Therefore, Jesus invited his disciples for the last supper. After the meal, he washed their hands and performed their ablutions to wipe their hands on his clothing. Afterwards Jesus replied to them: "As for that I have done to you tonight, in that I served you the meal and washed your hands in person, let it be an example for you. Since you indeed consider me to be better than you, do not be haughty in relation to each other but rather expand yourselves for each other as I have expanded myself for you." After instructing the disciples in his teachings, Jesus foretells that one of them would deny him and another betray him.

### Revelation

Muslims believe that God revealed to Jesus a new scripture, al-Injīl (the Gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: al-Tawrat (the Torah) and al-Zabur (the Psalms). The Quran speaks favorably of al-Injīl, which it describes as a scripture that fills the hearts of its followers with meekness and piety.

Regarding the Law of Moses, the Quran indicates that Jesus never abolished Jewish laws but rather confirmed them, while making partial abrogations only.
Islam rejects Paul's theology of justification before God by faith alone as held by some Protestants or faith through grace as held by Catholics, Orthodox and most mainline Protestants. Jesus' legal perspective did not involve a New Covenant concerning works, but to simply modify those existing laws. Shabir Ally considers this understanding to corroborate with the canonical gospels that include Matthew 5:17.

### Event of Crusifixion

Quranic story about crusifixion and nature of Jesus is quite different from that of the extant gospels.

The Glorious Qur'an affirms that Allah the Exalted did not permit the people of Israel to kill Jesus or crucify him. What happened was that Allah saved him from his enemies and raised him to heaven. They never killed Jesus; they killed someone else.

    And because of their saying (in boast), "We killed Messiah Jesus, son of Mary the Messenger of Allah," - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man (and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not (i.e. Jesus, son of Mary): But Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he is in the heavens). And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, all- Wise.

    And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary as only a Messenger of Allah and a human being), before his (Jesus or a Jew's or a Christian's) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against them.
    Quran Ayah 4:157-159

Almighty Allah also revealed: 

    [Mention] when Allāh said, "O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify [i.e., free] you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you [in submission to Allāh alone] superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you used to differ.
    Quran Ayah 3:55

## When will Jesus return?

</summary>

Both Islam and Christianity expect the return of Jesus at the end of times, and both expect trials and tribulations to occur at the time. Many of the themes of these trials are similar, but they are also very different in detail and definition. Both religions expect the nation of believers to be the final victors, but the Christian believes that these are defined as the believers in the Gospel of the New Testament and in Christ as ‘the Savior’ and ‘the Incarnation’ of God, whilst the Muslim knows that it refers to those who believe in the pure monotheism entailed in submission to the One and Only True God.

The return of Jesus is preceded in both religions by signs, again similar in general description, but subtly different in detail. Both religions teach that the return of Jesus will be preceded by a great and powerful figure of falsehood and temptation, called the Maseeh ad-Dajjal (The False Messiah) by the Muslims and the Anti-Christ by the Christians. Before this event other signs that agree with each other include a general increase in immorality and fornication, murder and crime, and general lawlessness, debauchery and falling away from religion and true knowledge. Accompanying these signs of civil malaise will be internecine wars, and natural disasters following closely one upon the other.

### Second coming of Jesus

According to Islamic tradition which describes this graphically, Jesus' descent will be in the midst of wars fought by the Mahdi (lit. "the rightly guided one"), known in Islamic eschatology as the redeemer of Islam, against al-Masih ad-Dajjal (the Antichrist "false messiah") and his followers. Jesus will descend at the point of a white minaret, east of Damascus (believed to be the Minaret of Isa in the Umayyad Mosque), dressed in yellow robes. He will say prayer behind al-Mahdi then join him in his war against the Dajjal. Jesus, considered as a Muslim, will abide by the Islamic teachings. Eventually, Jesus will slay the Antichrist, and then everyone who is one of the People of the Book (ahl al-kitāb, referring to Jews and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.

Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 3, Book 43: Kitab-ul-Ilm (Book of Knowledge), Hâdith Number 656:

> Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) descends amongst you as a just ruler, he will break the cross, kill the swine, and abolish the Jizya tax. Money will be in abundance so that nobody will accept it (as charitable gifts)."
> Narrated by Abu Huraira 🐈.

In another hadith, the Prophet (SAW) said: 
> "I hope that I would live long enough to see ʿĪsā, but if my death comes before that, whoever meets him should convey my salām to him."

ʿĪsā (AS) will not have returned as a new Prophet but rather as follower of the Prophet Muḥammad (SAW), adhering to the Sharīʿah he brought. As such, he will accede to the authority of the Khalīfah at the time, the Mahdī. Allāh’s Messenger (SAW) said, “How will you be when the son or Maryam descends amongst you, judging by the law of the Qurʾān and not the law of the Injīl?” and he once told ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb, “Were Mūsā alive today, he would have no option but to follow me.”

The ummah of Islām will start with the best of people and end with the best of people. The Prophet (SAW) said, “An ummah that has me at its beginning, the Mahdī in its middle, and ʿIsā at its end can never be destroyed.”

After defeating Dajjal, Isa will work as a judge. There will be a good life for some time untill Yajuj and Majuj come out of their dwelling places. Isa and the ummah will make dua against them and Allah will save the people.

Īsā (AS) will remain on earth for forty years after killing the Dajjāl and then pass away. The Muslims will offer the funeral prayer for him, and bury him.

For details, see #Isa will return to the Earth and defeat Dajjal.

## Apostles (Disciples of Jesus)

</summary>

The disciples of Jesus are known in the Quran and the traditions of Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, as Al-Hawariyoon.  This is an Arabic word meaning simply, the disciples of Jesus. However, hawariyoon, like many words in the Arabic language, has specific and general meanings, and in some cases, particularly in Islamic words, there are layers of meanings.

Hawari is derived from the root Arabic word hawr that means to whiten, to bleach, to purify, to clean, to change, to transform, to amend and to alter.  Hawari is a singular word and literally means, he who whitens clothes, he who has been appointed, chosen, and purified from all kinds of defects, and a companion or a helper. The plural is hawariyoon.   

Prophet Jesus’ companions were also known as apostles. The words apostles or disciples were used to differentiate Jesus’ close companions from followers whose numbers were steadily growing. Islamic scholars have pondered and discussed the reason for calling the disciples Al-Hawariyoon throughout Islamic history. Renowned Islamic Quran scholar Ibn Kathir states that the disciples were so named because of their white clothes and he also mentions the meaning of a helper or supporter. 

It is interesting to note that the majority of Jesus’ disciples were fishermen and their clothes would have been white due to their daily toil. The whiteness could then be extrapolated to include the whitening of people’s hearts through the teachings of Prophet Jesus. Other scholars have stated that hawari implies one who is capable of being a leader, and almost all scholars agree that a hawari is a sincere person or friend. 

The scholars of Christianity and Islam agree that Prophet Jesus was surrounded by twelve supporters, who were his close friends, companions. Quran has addressed Jesus’ companions as Al-Hawariyoon five times in four different verses.

At the time Jesus began his mission many Israelites were so far astray from the truth that Jesus considered it to be disbelief. He called them back to the worship of the One True God, yet most of those around him rejected his call and failed to heed his message. After revealing and clarifying that he is a Messenger from God, Jesus asks those listening to his message, who among them would be his helpers in God’s cause.

    Then when Jesus came to know of their disbelief, he said, "Who will be my helpers in God’s cause?" Al-Hawariyoon (the disciples) replied, "We are the helpers of God; we believe in God, so bear witness that we submit to God."
    Quran 3:52

They continued to pledge their allegiance to God and His Messenger Jesus.

    "‘Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down and we follow the Messenger (Jesus); so write us down among those who bear witness (to the truth).’" 
    Quran 3:53

Then in another chapter God Himself reveals that He was responsible for the people who became the disciples of Jesus, Al-Hawariyoon.

    "I (God) put it in the hearts of Al-Hawariyoon to believe in Me and My Messenger, they said: ‘We believe. And bear witness that we are submitted to God.’"
    Quran 5:111

The disciples were submitted to God; they followed the teachings of Jesus and were his companions and supporters. They helped him call the Israelites back to the worship of One God. Jesus never called himself God and the disciples were fully aware that they worshipped God and followed a man. It is the man known as the apostle Paul who called people to worship Jesus. It is wrong to assume that Paul was a disciple — he never met Jesus nor did he hear him speak or teach.   

Paul was a Pharisee, a Jewish sect that is strict in its observance of religious ceremonies and practices, and adherence to oral laws and traditions. Remarkably the secondary definition is a sanctimonious, self-righteous, or hypocritical person. Many thinkers and scholars believe that Paul almost singlehandedly destroyed the teachings of Jesus. 

The scholars of Islam reflect that there are two reasons why Paul would have joined the disciples after Jesus’ death. Either, in his role as a Pharisee, he was sent to undermine and sabotage the new movement, or the experience he had on the road to Damascus was a trick from Satan, designed to undermine and sabotage Jesus’ teachings. Quran is silent about Paul and also does not mention or imply that any of Jesus’ companions, Al-Hawariyoon, ever betrayed him.

Chapter five of the Quran is named The Table Spread with Food. It refers to Al-Hawariyoon asking Jesus if God could send down a table spread with food.  Jesus warned them not to speak so flippantly but nevertheless asked God to perform a miracle.

Among the reasons for their request was that the disciples wanted to be witnesses before all of humankind. They wanted to spread the message of Jesus by proclaiming the miracles they witnessed with their own eyes. The disciples followed the teaching of Jesus even after his death. Unfortunately, over time, the true message of Jesus and the faith of the disciples was discarded and forgotten. 

Islam holds the disciples of Jesus, Al-Hawariyoon, in high esteem. Prophet Muhammad, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, mentions Jesus and his disciples in his traditions. The Quran mentions their faith and their status as the helpers of Jesus, highlights their faith and sacrifice, and calls on the Companions of Prophet Muhammad to be like them.   

    O believers! Be supporters of God, as when Jesus, son of Mary, asked the disciples, "Who are my supporters for God?" The disciples replied, "We are supporters of God." Some of the Children of Israel believed and some disbelieved. We then supported the believers against their enemies, so they prevailed.
    Quran 61:14

This verse tells us that some of the Children of Israel heard Jesus’ message and believed him, while others disbelieved. Six hundred years later some people believed Prophet Muhammad while others turned their back and actively fought against Islam. Prophet Jesus and Prophet Muhammad both needed strong people around them. They needed helpers; they needed trustworthy people with conviction of faith. Al-Hawariyoon were the people of the inner circle, the ones Prophet Jesus could depend on, and the Companions were the ones who stood by and supported Prophet Muhammad.

> Prophet Muhammad said, "There is no Prophet who was sent by God to a nation before me except that he had hawariyoon and companions." 

During the campaign of al-Ahzab, the Prophet asked his Companions three times which of them would scout the disbeliever’s camp, and al-Zubayr volunteered each time. The Prophet said, "Every Prophet has a disciple (hawari), and my disciple is al-Zubayr." This story reflects a narration in Ibn Kathir’s commentary on the above verse, Quran 61:14, in which a young disciple volunteered three times to take the place of Jesus when Jesus and Al-Hawariyoon knew that harassment and arrest were probable.

Some groups of Prophet Muhammad’s Companions can be directly likened to the disciples of Jesus. When the fledgling Muslim community migrated to Medina, they were met and taken in by the residents of Medina, who came to be known as the Helpers, or the Ansar. They played a pivotal role in the establishment of the Islamic community. They embraced the emigrants as if they were family; they shared their homes, their food, their businesses and their wealth — all for the sake of God, and out of respect for Prophet Muhammad and his message. 

The leaders of the Children of Israel harassed Jesus and tried to make it very difficult for him to spread his message. While his followers understood that he was calling them back to the teachings of the Torah, the Jewish government of the time accused him of blasphemy. Jesus needed helpers to keep him safe, and he needed them to have a deep understanding of the message. 

Some of the Companions of Prophet Muhammad were given glad tidings of Paradise long before their deaths. They can also, in some respects, be compared to Al-Hawariyoon.

God chose Prophet Muhammad as a mercy to humankind and thus to spread the message of Islam. He also chose the people that would be close to him. In part one we mentioned that God Himself chose Al-Hawariyoon. He knew which people would be the best supporters of Prophet Jesus. God also knew who the best supporters of Prophet Muhammad would be. If we examine their lives, we will notice that there was something about the close Companions of Prophet Muhammad that made them different from all other men at the time, and this is why God chose them; they were trustworthy, honest and truthful men. They were men with strong characters, and they shared all these qualities with their Prophet. 

We are blessed to know a great deal about Prophet Muhammad’s Companions however we do not know as much about Al-Hawariyoon. What we do know is limited to what is in the Quran and the traditions of Prophet Muhammad. We do know that they possessed the same qualities as the Companions and were also chosen by God. From the freely available Christian texts we can glean very little. The Gospels can be interpreted in many ways and are colored by their contributors' and editors' reflections on events that had happened 60 or more years before they were written.   

Peter (Cephas) the man formerly known as Simon was very close to Jesus. Jesus changed his name; this was also one of Prophet Muhammad’s practices. If the name of a Companion had a bad meaning or a meaning in conflict with Islamic principles, Prophet Muhammad gave that person a better name. Jesus changed Simon’s name to one that was full of meaning. Peter (Cephas) means stone or rock, and scholars of the Gospels generally agree that Peter was a man of strong, unmovable conviction.

Prophet Muhammad mentions Jesus in some of his sayings and from his words we are able to deduce a little more about Jesus and his disciples. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   considered Jesus to be like a brother. 

> "Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all people to Jesus, the son of Mary. The Prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one."

Both Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Jesus shared a mission and were both surrounded and protected by men who shared their devotion to God and His cause.

## Early Christianity

</summary>

> Early Christianity is generally reckoned by church historians to begin with the ministry of Jesus (c. 27–30) and end with the First Council of Nicaea (325). It is typically divided into two periods: the Apostolic Age (c. 30–100, when the first apostles were still alive) and the Ante-Nicene Period (c. 100–325).

### Jewish Christians

The Apostolic Age is named after the Apostles and their missionary activities. It holds special significance in Christian tradition as the age of the direct apostles of Jesus. A primary source for the Apostolic Age is the Acts of the Apostles, but its historical accuracy has been debated and its coverage is partial, focusing especially from Acts 15 onwards on the ministry of Paul, and ending around 62 AD with Paul preaching in Rome under house arrest.

The earliest followers of Jesus were a sect of apocalyptic Jewish Christians within the realm of Second Temple Judaism. The early Christian groups were strictly Jewish, such as the Ebionites, and the early Christian community in Jerusalem, led by James the Just, brother of Jesus. According to Acts 9,they described themselves as "disciples of the Lord" and [followers] "of the Way", and according to Acts 11, a settled community of disciples at Antioch were the first to be called "Christians". 

Early Christians were all Jews as Jesus himself.
* They were fulfilling the covenant by circumsising their male children; 
* They did not eat pork;
* They worshiped one God and prayed to God alone;
* They greeted each other with "Shalom!" (Peace!)
* And they considered Jesus to be a promied Messiah

## How Paul corrupted Christianity

</summary>

Early Christians were all Jews as Jesus himself.
* They were fulfilling the covenant by circumsising their male children; 
* They did not eat pork;
* They worshiped one God and prayed to God alone;
* They greeted each other with "Shalom!" (Peace!)
* And they considered Jesus to be a promied Messiah

In the New Testament, in Matthew 5:17 Jesus states why he came:

> "Think not that I have come to abolish the law of the prophets but to fulfill them."
> Matthew 5:17

The Law that he is referring to is the Torah, which is the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (The Old Testament). 
Jesus' mission was to bring Jews back to the old ways of theology. He said:

> "You change not a jot or a title in Scripture"

Paul, who never saw Jesus personally, was prosecuting Christians. But at some point he declared himself a convert and an Apostole. Paul could not convince Jews that Jesus was divine so he went outside of Israel to the Gentiles (anyone who is not a Jew). 

He started preaching to Gentiles that Jesus died for sins of all humankind and that Christians do not need to follow the Law anymore.

Early Christians opposed Paul. Paul wrongfully began calling people to worship Jesus Christ and spread strange teachings. Due to his power, wealth, and relationships, people started to adopt these strange beliefs and teachings, while the true disciples of Jesus Christ disapproved.

The disciples clashed and argued with Paul because of his innovative and bizarre teachings, and the New Testament references this fact. Many Christians mistakenly took him as one of the disciples of Jesus Christ due to his claim that he was, but he was not, nor did he ever meet Jesus Christ. While some Christians elevate Paul to sainthood, Paul was responsible for destroying the teachings of Jesus Christ. He told people they did not need to follow God’s laws, even though Jesus Christ suffered and struggled to convey the Message of God, which included teaching people to obey God’s commandments.

The Bible clearly states the imprtance of following the law.
> Till Heaven and earth pass, the one that breaks the Law will be called the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished’ ‘Therefore anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.’
> Matthew 5:18–19

Almost all the concepts of the modern-day teachings of Christianity, including the concept of Jesus Christ being the son of God and Atonement, are from Paul — and not from the teachings of Jesus Christ. As such, the teachings of Paul contradict the teachings of Jesus.

While Prophets of God performed miracles to prove they were sent from God, such as when Jesus Christ healed leprosy and the blind, Paul did not perform any miracles or show any proof whatsoever that he was carrying the Word of God or even the words of the Prophet Jesus PBUH. Paul changed his name from Saul to distance himself from his former reputation as an enemy of Jesus Christ and a prosecutor of Jesus Christ’s disciples.

Paul met the disciples of Christ occasionally but was not fortunate enough to live in their company. When he later came into the picture after the departure of Jesus Christ, he made some severe changes to the religion to win over the Gentiles (non-Jewish people). He introduced what became vital concepts of Christianity, including the idea that Christ is the Son of God, that he sacrificed himself on the cross to save humanity, and that all one needs to do to earn Paradise is to believe Christ died for his sins. Half of the New Testament is written by this man who never met Jesus Christ in his lifetime.

The New Testament that is now in existence contains more writings of Paul than any other source. All his reports were written before the four Gospels. They are influenced mainly by the teachings and innovations of Paul, even though his writings consist of hundreds of inconsistences and contradictions! Paul abolished God’s laws, such as not eating pork, fasting, observing the Sabbath, and the instruction of circumcision.

The early devoted followers of Jesus Christ struggled for years to uphold the teaching that only One God (the Father) should be worshiped, and Jesus Christ was only His human Messenger. The real followers of Jesus Christ opposed the blatant misrepresentations that Paul was wrongfully decimating.

Because of Paul's preaching Christianity was divided into two denominations: Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians.

Paul is a self-proclaimed Apostle, who never saw Jesus. The agenda of Paul was significantly different from the agenda of Jesus. Paul is viewed in Islam in a very negative way because he corrupted original teachings of Jesus.

Paul never met Jesus in person. Paul brought many innovations from Greek mythology, including the concept of "human sacrifice" and "died for your sins". Not only he went astray from the straight path but he also led many people to the wrong path.

</details><details><summary>

## "Trinity" appeared 150 years later after Jesus

</summary>

Since the innovative teachings of Paul appealed to the Gentiles (non-Jewish people), Jesus’ faithful followers were unable to stop Paul’s misguidance. Although the first Christians were Unitarians who asserted the unity of God and would have rejected the doctrine of the Trinity, Jesus Christ’s message of the absolute Oneness of God lasted in its original purity for only a short time, then diminished over the years. The very first Christians were not Trinitarians and, in fact, never had heard of the Trinity, as many current-day Biblical scholars acknowledge.

Some Christians developed different beliefs about the Prophet Jesus PBUH over the next few centuries. They claimed that he was divine, calling him the Son of God, which eventually became the dominant Christian belief. Sadly, Christian leaders took Paul’s beliefs as their religion even though his teachings contradict the Bible, and Christian leaders abandoned the actual teachings of Jesus Christ. Many Biblical scholars recognize and admit that the formulation of modern Christianity did not begin with Jesus Christ; instead, the faith started with Paul, as shocking as that sounds. Sadly, Paul, not Jesus Christ, is the true founder of modern Christianity. Today, only Muslims follow the actual teachings of Jesus Christ, which we will prove later in this book.

About a 150 years later, after the departure of Jesus Christ, a Church father by the name of Tertullian began teaching and spreading the concept of the Trinity.

## 250 AD: Sleepers in the Cave 😴😴🐕⛰️

</summary>

The story of the Companions of the Cave ( أصحاب الکهف, ) is referred to in Quran 18:9-26. Several righteous people and one dog hid inside the cave outside the city of Ephesus around AD 250 to escape one of the Roman persecutions of Christians and emerged some 300 years later.

The precise number of the sleepers is not stated. The Quran furthermore points to the fact that people, shortly after the incident emerged, started to make "idle guesses" as to how many people were in the cave. To this the Quran asserts that: "My Sustainer knows best how many they were".

Similarly, regarding the exact period of time the people stayed in the cave, the Quran, after asserting the guesswork of the people that "they remained in the cave for 300 years and nine added", resolves that "God knows best how long they remained [there]." The Quran says the sleepers included a dog, who sat at the entrance of the cave (verse 18). 

## Christian Interpretation

The story says that during the persecutions by the Roman emperor Decius, around AD 250, seven young men were accused of following Christianity. They were given some time to recant their faith, but they refused to bow to Roman idols. Instead they chose to give their worldly goods to the poor and retire to a mountain cave to pray, where they fell asleep. The Emperor, seeing that their attitude towards paganism had not improved, ordered the mouth of the cave to be sealed.

Decius died in 251, and many years passed during which Christianity went from being persecuted to being the state religion of the Roman Empire. At some later time — usually given as during the reign of Theodosius II (408–450) — in AD 447 when heated discussions were taking place between various schools of Christianity about the resurrection of the body in the day of judgement and life after death, a landowner decided to open up the sealed mouth of the cave, thinking to use it as a cattle pen. He opened it and found the sleepers inside. They awoke, imagining that they had slept but one day, and sent one of their number to Ephesus to buy food, with instructions to be careful.

Upon arriving in the city, this person was astounded to find buildings with crosses attached; the townspeople for their part were astounded to find a man trying to spend old coins from the reign of Decius. The bishop was summoned to interview the sleepers; they told him their miracle story, and died praising God.

## 330: Roman Emperor Constantine converts to Christianity

</summary>

About three hundred years after the departure of Jesus Christ, the Roman Pagan Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity and adopted this strange minority view of Christianity. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God and that all one has to do to attain salvation is to accept the fact that he died for our sins. Constantine believed in many concepts that date back to Roman Paganism. So, the Roman Empire became Christian.

Constantine I initiated the [First Council of Nicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Council_of_Nicaea) that changed the original course of Christianity.

Fun fact: It is the same Constantine the founder of Constantinople.

</details><details><summary>

## 325 AD: Nicene Creed

</summary>

> Modern Christianity is based on the following unfortunate turn of eventsm which corrupted original teachings of Jesus:
> -- 31--36 AD: Paul, who never saw Jesus, proclaimed himself an Apostol.
> -- Paul preached that Jesus is the son of God to non-Jewish people.
> -- Paul preached that Jesus died for sins of the humanity.
> -- Paul preached that people do not need to follow the Law of the Old Testament.
> -- Modern version of the New Testament mostly consists of Paul's letters that contain many contradictions.
> -- 150 AD: The first mention of the Trinity appears only some 150 years after Jesus left the earth.
> -- Early Christians who believed that Jesus was a prophet were prosecuted. After Paul's preaching Christianity divided into two main branches. One of them believed that Jesus as a prophet and a messiah, the others supported Paul's version.
> -- 312 AD: Roman Emperor Contantine I converted to Christianity.
> -- 325 AD: Nicaean Creed. Contantine gathers church representatives and they decide that the Paul's version of Christianity will be official, thus declaring Jesus to be the son of God. They also decided that the Spirit is a God as well. This contradicted the original Arbrahamic dogma of a "monotheistic" religion in which there could be only one God. So, they decided that all three Gods are united in one entitity, making it the Trinity and destroying the logic.
> -- At the Nicaean Creed, Arius (an Alexandrian priest who claimed that God alone is Almighty and Jesus is dependend from God) was declared a herethic and was exiled. 
> -- After Nicaean Creed, Constantine and the Pauline Church took hundreds of manuscripts and Gospels that contradicted Paul’s views banned and destroyed them. Some of these manuscripts were written by the Disciples themselves. The ancient manuscripts, written initially in the original Aramaic and Hebrew, were destroyed, and only the Greek and Latin manuscripts were spared.
> -- People from non-Pauline branches of Christianity were persecuted, tortured and killed as herethics. Up until they slowly vanished.

First counsil of Nicaea. After converting to Christianity, the Emperor Constantine contacted the Council of Nicaea to discuss and resolve whether Jesus Christ is the Son of God and other related matters. The council of the Christian leaders at Nicaea understood Paul’s strange belief set as the sect of Christianity they would follow. Constantine was the first Emperor to make Christianity a state religion after Christians had been persecuted and killed for three hundred years — simply for being Christian. The worship of the Roman sun god was rampant during this period.

Constantine’s strange sect of Christianity slowly grew in numbers, and the Pauline Church eventually gave birth to the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Protestant Church. Constantine banned all other Christian sects and executed millions who followed other Christian denominations. Only a tiny remnant remained of the actual teachings of Jesus Christ. God says in his final Book that modern-day Christianity is based upon the whims of misguided people, who in turn misguide others:

    Say, "People of the Book, do not overstep the bounds of Truth in your religious beliefs. Do not follow the whims of the people who went astray before you. They have led many others astray, and they continue to stray from the right path"
    Quran 5:7

It is very problematic that Christians take the words of Paul and others who came after the teachings of Jesus Christ to be more valid than the words of Jesus Christ. Modern Christianity has been reduced to an interpretation of the words of Jesus Christ within the context of Paul. Constantine and the Pauline Church also took hundreds of manuscripts and Gospels that contradicted Paul’s views banned and destroyed them. Some of these manuscripts were written by the Disciples themselves. The ancient manuscripts, written initially in the original Aramaic and Hebrew, were destroyed, and only the Greek and Latin manuscripts were spared.

Nicaea was all about Arius and Constantine wanted to establish peace among his own ruling lands. Unfortunately, they chose the corrupted version of Christianity.

Peter the Venerable said that prophet Muhammad ﷺ    was the successor to Arius. The original Christianity was very close to original Jewish religion and Islam. Jesus was Jewish and he was circumsized, he prayed to God prostrating to earth and he greeted people with "Shalom". 

Jesus attended Jewish temples and he just logically couldn't claim that he is God. The disciples also attended Jewish temples and worshipped God alone. 
Jesus came to revive the religion of Moses, not to build new churches and invent a new religion.

God is self-sufficient. Jesus ate, slept and prayed. God is not born. Jesus and his followers went to Jewish temples and prayed the same way Moses and Ibrahim prayed. There are multiple times in the Gospels a statement that noone has seen God. According to the Bible, even Jesus himself said: "I have never seen God". And in that time period, many good people were called son of God.

Jesus prayed to God prostating his face to the ground.

It is important to take into account that the Bible cannot be fully called the Word of God because it was translated from it's original language and corrupted by writers of multiple epochs. The Quran, on contrary, remains in the original Arabic language up to this day.

Hadith from Sahih Muslim, the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    said:

> Allah chose Kinanah from descendends of Ismail.
> He chose Quraish from Kinanah.
> He chose Banu Hashim from Quraish.
> He chose me from Banu Hashim.

<img src="/pre-islamic-arabia.PNG" alt="Early Expansion"> 

Arab traditions relating to the origins and classification of the Arabian tribes is based on biblical genealogy. The general consensus among 14th-century Arabic genealogists was that Arabs were three kinds:
* "Perishing Arabs": These are the ancients of whose history little is known. They include ʿĀd, Thamud, Tasm, Jadis, Imlaq and others. Jadis and Tasm perished because of genocide. ʿĀd and Thamud perished because of their decadence. Some people in the past doubted their existence, but Imlaq is the singular form of 'Amaleeq and is probably synonymous to the biblical Amalek.
* "Pure Arabs" (Qahtanite): These are traditionally considered to have originated from the progeny of Ya'rub bin Yashjub bin Qahtan so were also called Qahtanite Arabs.
* "Arabized Arabs" (Adnanite): They are traditionally seen as having descended from Adnan.

The several different tribes throughout Arabian history are traditionally regarded as having emerged from two main branches: the Rabiah, from which amongst others the Banu Hanifa emerged, and the Mudhar, from which amongst others the Banu Kinanah (and later Muhammad's own tribe, the Quraysh) emerged.

Main tribes of pre-Islamic Arabia:

* Ghifar
* Ghatafan
* Hanifa
* Quraish. Clans of Quraish:
  * Banu Makhzum
  * Banu Hashim
  * Banu Zuhra
  * Banu Nawfal
  * Banu Abd Shams
  * Banu Adi ...
* Hawazin
* Ka'b
* Azd
* Kindah

### Religion 

> Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “I saw ‘Amra ibn ‘Amr ibn Luhayy al-Khuza’i dragging his intestines in the Hellfire. He introduced the custom of releasing animals on behalf of false gods.”

> In another narration, the Prophet said, “He was the first to change the religion of Ishmael and set up idols.”
> Source: Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī 3521

‘Amr ibn Luhayy was a chieftan of the Khuza'a tribe. It is narrated that 'Amr travelled to Sirya, to the Amalkites, he found them worshipping idols. They said they pray to idols for power and when we have drought or we are under attack. 'Amr asked for an idol, they gave him Hubal.

Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia included pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, ancient Semitic religions (religions predating the Abrahamic religions which themselves likewise originated among the ancient Semitic-speaking peoples), Abrahamic religions such as Christianity, Judaism, and Mandaeism, and Iranian religions such as Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism. Arabian polytheism was, according to Islamic tradition, the dominant form of religion in pre-Islamic Arabia, based on veneration of deities and spirits. Worship was directed to various gods and goddesses, including Hubal and the goddesses al-Lāt, Al-'Uzzá and Manāt, at local shrines and temples, maybe such as the Kaaba in Mecca. Deities were venerated and invoked through a variety of rituals, including pilgrimages and divination, as well as ritual sacrifice. Different theories have been proposed regarding the role of Allah in Meccan religion. Many of the physical descriptions of the pre-Islamic gods are traced to idols, especially near the Kaaba, which is said to have contained up to 360 of them in Islamic tradition.

Other religions were represented to varying, lesser degrees. The influence of the adjacent Roman and Aksumite resulted in Christian communities in the northwest, northeast and south of Arabia. Christianity made a lesser impact, but secured some conversions, in the remainder of the peninsula. With the exception of Nestorianism in the northeast and the Persian Gulf, the dominant form of Christianity was Miaphysitism. The peninsula had been a destination for Jewish migration since pre-Roman times, which had resulted in a diaspora community supplemented by local converts. Additionally, the influence of the Sasanian Empire resulted in Iranian religions being present in the peninsula. While Zoroastrianism existed in the eastern and southern Arabia, there was no existence of Manichaeism in Mecca.

Sam (Shem) was a righteous son of Noah according to the Book of Genesis. Book of Genesis says that descendands of Shem, Ham and Japheth populated Asia, Africa and Europe correspondingly.

<img src="/shem.jpg" alt="Shem, Ham and Japheth"> 

Descendends of Shem or Semites include Arabs, Akkadians, Canaanites, Hebrews, some Ethiopians (including the Amhara and the Tigrayans), and Aramaean tribes.

Yagrub's father was Kakhtan and believed to be the starter of the Arab languange.

Most probably the son of Adnan lived at the time of Isa AS. According to tradition, Adnan is the father of a group of the Ishmaelite Arabs who inhabited West and Northern Arabia; he is a descendant of Ishmael, son of Abraham. Adnan is believed by genealogists to be the father of many Ishmaelite tribes along the Western coast of Arabia, Northern Arabia and Iraq.

Many family trees have been presented by Adnan, which did not agree about the number of ancestors between Ishmael and Adnan but agreed about the names and number of the ancestors between Adnan and the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

570 years passed between Isa and the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  .

<img src="/prophet_muhammad_ancestors.PNG" alt="Ancestors of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ  ">
Kinanah was known for his bravery and wisdom. People would do hajj to meet Kinanah. 3 people have a founding role in founding Quraish. 
* The Quraish was the best and the Bani Hashim tribe was the best, the most noble tribe.
* Mudr was the first to use camels into caravans.
* Kinanah was noble. People used to do Hajj to meet Kinana. He was a legendary Arab full of knowledge. from Kinana Allah chose Quraish. 
* One person who combines all Quraish is Fahr. All ten people who are promised Paradise in the hadith are from Quraish. There are about 12 tribes of Quraish. 

**Khusay** gathered Quraish tribes, reclaimed Mecca for Quraish and made the rules of Kaaba and hospitality and storing of the key and water. There was no **Zamzam** at that time. When Khuzahah attacked Jurhum, people buried the well of Zamzam. for over 300 years people were forced to dig wells from other places.

**Hashim** extablished trading between Basra and Yemen. Hashim became wealthy. Hashim fed the pilgrims. The surah Quraish is about those seasonal caravans. it wasnot allowed to rob Quraish caravans because they protected the Qaaba. One of wives of Hashim was from Yathrib. So the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    had blood relations with the Ansar.  

### Political Conditions in Arabia
The most remarkable feature of the political life of Arabia before Islam was the total absence of political organization in any form. With the exception of Yemen in the south-west, no part of the Arabian peninsula had any government at any time, and the Arabs never acknowledged any authority other than the authority of the chiefs of their tribes. The authority of the tribal chiefs, however, rested, in most cases, on their character and personality, and was moral rather than political.

The modern student of history finds it incredible that the Arabs lived, generation after generation, century after century, without a government of any kind. Since there was no government, there was no law and no order.

The only law of the land was lawlessness. In the event a crime was committed, the injured party took law in its own hands, and tried to administer “justice” to the offender. This system led very frequently to acts of horrendous cruelty.

If the Arab ever exercised any modicum of restraint, it was not because of any susceptibility he had to questions of right or wrong but because of the fear of provoking reprisals and vendetta. Vendetta consumed whole generations of Arabs.

Since there were no such things as police, courts or judges, the only protection a man could find from his enemies, was in his own tribe. The tribe had an obligation to protect its members even if they had committed crimes. Tribalism or ‘asabiyya (the clan spirit) took precedence over ethics. A tribe that failed to protect its members from their enemies, exposed itself to ridicule, obloquy and contempt. Ethics, of course, did not enter the picture anywhere.

Since Arabia did not have a government, and since the Arabs were anarchists by instinct, they were locked up in ceaseless warfare. War was a permanent institution of the Arabian society. The desert could support only a limited number of people, and the state of inter-tribal war maintained a rigid control over the growth of population. But the Arabs themselves did not see war in this light.

To them, war was a pastime or rather a dangerous sport, or a species of tribal drama, waged by professionals, according to old and gallant codes, while the “audience” cheered. Eternal peace held no appeal for them, and war provided an escape from drudgery and from the monotony of life in the desert.

They, therefore, courted the excitement of the clash of arms. War gave them an opportunity to display their skills at archery, fencing and horsemanship, and also, in war, they could distinguish themselves by their heroism and at the same time win glory and honor for their tribes. In many cases, the Arabs fought for the sake of fighting, whether or not there was a cause belli.

G. E. Grunebaum:
>“In the century before the rise of Islam the tribes dissipated all their energies in tribal guerrilla fighting, all against all.” (Classical Islam – A History 600-1258 – 1970)

The nomadic tribes ranged over the peninsula and plundered the caravans and the small settlements. Many caravans and villages bought immunity from these raids by paying a fixed amount of money to the nomadic freebooters.

It is important to grasp the fact that on the eve of the birth of Islam there was no government at any level in Arabia, and this fact may even have affected the rise of Islam itself.The total absence of government, even in its most rudimentary form, was a phenomenon so extraordinary that it has been noted and commented upon by many orientalists.

### Economic Conditions
Economically, the Jews were the leaders of Arabia. They were the owners of the best arable lands in Hijaz, and they were the best farmers in the country. They were also the entrepreneurs of such industries as existed in Arabia in those days, and they enjoyed a monopoly of the armaments industry.

Slavery was an economic institution of the Arabs. Male and female slaves were sold and bought like animals, and they formed the most depressed class of the Arabian society.

The most powerful class of the Arabs was made up by the capitalists and money-lenders. The rates of interest which they charged on loans were exorbitant, and were especially designed to make them richer and richer, and the borrowers poorer and poorer.

The most important urban centers of Arabia were Makkah and Yathrib, both in Hijaz. The citizens of Makkah were mostly merchants, traders and money-lenders. Their caravans traveled in summer to Syria and in winter to Yemen.

They also traveled to Bahrain in the east and to Iraq in the northeast. The caravan trade was basic to the economy of Makkah, and its organization called for considerable skill, experience and ability.

R. V. C. Bodley:
> The arrivals and departures of caravans were important events in the lives of the Meccans. Almost everyone in Mecca had some kind of investment in the fortunes of the thousands of camels, the hundreds of men, horses, and donkeys which went out with hides, raisins, and silver bars, and came back with oils, perfumes and manufactured goods from Syria, Egypt and Persia, and with spices and gold from the south. (The Messenger, 1946, p. 31)

In Yathrib, the Arabs made their living by farming, and the Jews made theirs as businessmen and industrialists. But the Jews were not exclusively businessmen and industrialists; among them also there were many farmers, and they had brought much waste land under cultivation.

Economically, socially and politically, Hijaz was the most important province in Arabia in the early seventh century.

### Religion

The period in the Arabian history which preceded the birth of Islam is known as the Times of Ignorance. Judging by the beliefs and the practices of the pagan Arabs, it appears that it was a most appropriate name. The Arabs were the devotees of a variety of “religions” which can be classified into the following categories.

1. Idol-worshippers or polytheists. Most of the Arabs were idolaters. They worshipped numerous idols and each tribe had its own idol or idols and fetishes. They had turned the Kaaba in Makkah, which according to tradition, had been built by the Prophet Abraham and his son, Ismael, and was dedicated by them to the service of One God, into a heathen pantheon housing 360 idols of stone and wood.

2. Atheists This group was composed of the materialists and believed that the world was eternal.

3. Zindiqs They were influenced by the Persian doctrine of dualism in nature. They believed that there were two gods representing the twin forces of good and evil or light and darkness, and both were locked up in an unending struggle for supremacy.

4. Sabines. They worshipped the stars.

5. Jews When the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70, and drove the Jews out of Palestine and Syria, many of them found new homes in Hijaz in Arabia. Under their influence, many Arabs also became converts to Judaism. Their strong centers were the towns of Yathrib, Khaybar, Fadak and Umm-ul-Qura.

6. Christians. The Romans had converted the north Arabian tribe of Ghassan to Christianity. Some clans of Ghassan had migrated to and had settled in Hijaz. In the south, there were many Christians in Yemen where the creed was originally brought by the Ethiopian invaders. Their strong center was the town of Najran.

7. Monotheists There was a small group of monotheists present in Arabia on the eve of the rise of Islam. Its members did not worship idols, and they were the followers of the Prophet Abraham.

For details, see [Arabia Before Islam](https://www.al-islam.org/restatement-history-islam-and-muslims-sayyid-ali-asghar-razwy/arabia-islam)

### Poetry

Another thing to mention is that Arabia at that time was famous for its poetry. Poetry was part of their historical culture and a popular activity. Famous poets were respected and regarded. And they have perfected their art of poetry through generations and knew how to see good poetry from bad ones. The best poets used to write and recite about current or past events in form of witty metaphors, jokes and rhymes.

This is also a very important part of Arabic culture. And later, when these people heard the Quran, they were amazed by its beauty, even though Quran is not poetry.

## Jaahiliyah

</summary>

The Age of Ignorance (جَاهِلِيَّة‎, , lit. 'ignorance') is an Islamic concept referring to the period of time and state of affairs in Arabia before the advent of Islam in 610 CE. The term jahiliyyah is derived from the verbal root jahala "to be ignorant or stupid, to act stupidly".

The term Jahiliyyah is used several places in the Quran, and translations often use various terms to represent it:

    Then, following misery, He sent down upon you a feeling of security, a slumber overcoming a party among you, while another party cared only for themselves, thinking false thoughts about God, thoughts fit for the Age of Idolatry. 
    Quran 3:154

    Do they truly desire the law of paganism? But who is fairer than God in judgment for a people firm of faith?
    Quran 5:50

    Remain in your homes, and do not display your adornments, as was the case with the earlier Age of Barbarism. 
    Quran 33:33

    For the unbelievers had planted in their hearts a zealotry, the zealotry of lawlessness ... 
    Quran 48:26

Before the Islamic conversion a portion of the Arab tribes were nomadic, with a strong community spirit and some specific society rules. Their culture was patriarchal, with rudimentary religious beliefs. Although there were some traces of monotheism in the "hanifs" figures, their religious beliefs were based mostly on idol adorations and social congregations once a year around the Kaaba for trading and exchanges. Since the term is, in its deep sense, used as a condition, and not as an historical period, the Jahiliyya is used to describe the period of ignorance and darkness that pre-dated the arrival of Islam. 

The Arabs and the Jews both practiced usury. Many among them were professional usurers; they lived on the interest they charged on their loans.

E. A. Belyaev:
> “Usury (riba) was widely practiced in Mecca, for in order to participate in the profitable caravan trade many a Meccan who had only a modest income had to resort to usurers; despite the high interest, he could hope to benefit after the safe return of the caravan. The richer merchants were both traders and usurers.
>
> Money-lenders usually took a dinar for a dinar, a dirhem for a dirhem, in other words, 100 per cent interest. In the Koran 3:130, Allah addressing the faithful, prescribes:
> 
> `Do not practice usury doubled twofold.`
> 
> This could mean that interests of 200 or even 400 per cent were demanded. The nets of Meccan usury caught not only fellow-citizens and tribesmen but also members of the Hijazi.
>
> Bedouin tribes active in the Meccan trade. As in ancient Athens, ‘the principal means of oppressing the people's freedom were money and usury.”

There was a tribe that buried their newborn girls alive.

Arabia was a male-dominated society. Women had no status of any kind other than as sex objects.The number of women a man could marry was not fixed. When a man died, his son “inherited” all his wives except his own mother.

A savage custom of the Arabs was to bury their female infants alive. Even if an Arab did not wish to bury his daughter alive, he still had to uphold this “honorable” tradition, being unable to resist social pressures.

Drunkenness was a common vice of the Arabs. With drunkenness went their gambling. They were compulsive drinkers and compulsive gamblers. The relations of the sexes were extremely loose. Many women sold sex to make their living since there was little else they could do.

### Jurhumites bury Zamzam

Jurhumites from Yemen were rulers of Mecca for some time. They started committing injustice and were finally driven out. When Khuza'ah attacked Jurhum, Jurhum hid the Zamzam before they leave. Before going, they buried Zamzam in the sand.

### Idols are placed around the Kaaba

A chieftan from Kuza'ah when coming back from Syria asked the Moabites(or the giants tribe) to give him one of their idols. They gave him Hubal, which he brought back to sanctuary, setting it up within the Ka'bah itself; and it became the chief idol of Mecca. Later on, people brought many other idols to Kaaba.

After idols were placed around the Kaaba, Jews ceased to visit the temple of Abraham.

## Jurhumites bury Zamzam Well

</summary>

After Hājar (Hagar of the Bible), the wife of the Ibrāhīm (Abraham) and their son Ismā’īl (Ishmael) had settled in Mecca, the tribe of Jurhum, happened to pass through there and agreed with Hājar that they should remain there as a new spring of fresh water had emerged at that location.[citation needed] They settled in Mecca and in the area around. Once Ismā’īl had become a youth he married a woman of the tribe of Jurhum. Ismā’īl was the custodian of the Sacred House (Ka’bah), and after he died he made his son Nābit his successor. And then after Nābit the job was given to his uncles from Jurhum, and with them were the descendants of Ismā’īl. Then Muḑāḑah ibn 'Amr al-Jurhamī assumed the burden of the affairs of the Sacred House.

Jurhum's custodianship of the Sanctuary lasted for a period of time, but they then started to become weaker in faith, putting the continuing sanctity of the Sacred House at peril. They considered all the funds collected at the Sanctuary to be their property, and started to perform sinful acts within its precincts. It came to the point where a man and a woman, called Asāf and Nā’ilah, performed coitus in the Sacred House, and according to the Muslim sources Allah turned them into two stones to punish them for this sacrilegious act.

Their aggression against the sanctity of the Sanctuary was the catalyst that made the Banū Bakr bin ‘Abd al-Manāf bin Kinānah, descendants of Ismā’īl, join with Khuzā’ah in fighting Jurhum and they expelled them from Mecca.

After the Jurhumites had fled, Khuzā’ah became custodians of the Sacred House, passing the duty on from father to son for a long time, five hundred years it is said. The first one of Khuzā’ah to govern the Sacred House was ‘Amr bin Rabī’ah (Luḥay) who travelled to Syria-Palestine (al-Shām) to seek a cure for a disease he was suffering from; he found the people there worshiping idols, and he liked this religion, so he brought back an idol called Hubal back to Mecca and called on the people to worship it. Hubal had the figure of an old man with a long beard and was made of carnelian. Its right hand had been cut off but the Quraysh would later provide it with a hand made of gold. 'Amr ibn Rabī'ah then was the first to change the religion of the Arabs. Muslims historians consider that the people of Mecca were following the monotheistic religion of Ibrāhīm and Ismā'īl up to this point (see Hanif), when polytheism was introduced. 'Amr ibn Luḥay became very famous among the other Arab tribes, because he fed all the pilgrims to the Sacred House, and distributed Yemeni cloaks to them. Many of the tribes started to visit Mecca on pilgrimage, and took their own idols with them, placing them around the Ka'bah to worship.

## The Quraysh Tribe

</summary>

Arabia before Islam
Jaahiliyah
Tribes worship idols around the Kaaba
Jurhumites bury Zamzam

Quraish tribes are united by Qusay
Quraish take control of Mecca
Quraish feed pillgrims that come to Kaaba
Hashim tells people to build houses in the Kaaba region
Hashim established Mecca as a caravan route stop
Abd-Al Muttalib rediscovers Zamzam well

The Quraysh ( قُرَيْشٌ, ) were a grouping of Arab clans that historically inhabited and controlled the city of Mecca and its Kaaba. The Islamic prophet Muhammad was born into the Hashim clan of the tribe. The Quraysh gained their name when Qusayy ibn Kilab, a sixth-generation descendant of Fihr ibn Malik, gathered together his kinsmen and took control of the Ka'aba. Prior to this, Fihr's offspring lived in scattered, nomadic groups among their Kinana relatives.

Ibn Ishaq's account reveals that Mecca in the time of Qusayy and his immediate offspring was not yet a commercial center; rather, the city's economy was based on pilgrimage to the Ka'ba, and "what pass[ed] for municipal offices [designated by Qusayy] have to do only with military operations and with control of the shrine". During that time, the tribesmen of Quraysh were not traders; instead, they were entrusted with religious services, from which they significantly profited. They also profited from taxes collected from incoming pilgrims. Though Qusayy appeared to be the strongman of Quraysh, he was not officially a king of the tribe, but one of many leading sheikhs (tribal chieftains).

### Qusayy ibn Kilay

> In the fifth century A.D. a man called Qusay, was born in the tribe of Quraysh. He won great honor and fame for his tribe by his wisdom. He rebuilt the Kaaba which was in a state of disrepair, and he ordered the Arabs to build their houses around it. He also built the “town hall” of Makkah, the first one in Arabia.
> 
> The leaders of the various clans gathered in this hall to ponder upon their social, commercial, cultural and political problems. Qusay formulated laws for the supply of food and water to the pilgrims who came to Makkah, and he persuaded the Arabs to pay a tax for their support.

At that time, Khuza'ah was controlling Mecca. Qusayy ibn Kilay from Quraish married chieftan's daughter and after the chieftan died, people wanted Qusayy to take over so he united Quraish tribes and fought against sons of Khuzagha chieftan and reclaimed the control over Mecca for the Quraish.

Qusayy was the great-great-greatfather of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . after battles it was agreed that Qusay from Quraish must be the guardian of the Kaaba. They were receiving taxes, feeding the pilgrims and living in tents. Qusayy told them to build houses. His hidden qualities enabled him to establish his superiority over the Meccans and especially the tribe of Quraysh. Within a short time he acquired the high governmental offices in Makkah and also became the custodian of the keys of the Ka'bah and the undisputed ruler of that city.

Many remarkable events are associated with his name. One of these was that he encouraged the people to construct a house with the name of 'Darun Nadwah' adjacent to the Ka'bah and thus founded a Council Hall for the Arabs so that their dignitaries and chiefs might sit together in this public centre and solve their problems. He died in the 5th A.D. and left behind two sons named Abdud Dar and Abd Manaf.

### 464–497: Hashim

Hashim was a son of Abd Manaf ibn Qusay. Hāshim ibn ʿAbd Manāf, born ʿAmr al-ʿUlā, was the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the progenitor of the ruling Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe in Mecca.  Hashim was the father of Abdul Muttalib. He established caravans to Yemen and Syria. 

The silk road was going through Basra. So Hashim hooked to the Silk Road and connected Yemen and Basra. and in the middle was Mecca. and Mecca had people who would come to Hajj, so there was the market.

and it was a safe route because of Mecca was a holy sight.
Surah Quraish mentions these caravans.

    For the accustomed security of the Quraysh –
    Their accustomed security [in] the caravan of winter and summer –
    Let them worship the Lord of this House,
    Who has fed them, [saving them] from hunger and made them safe, [saving them] from fear.
    Quran, surah Quraish

Hashim married an influential Yathrib woman from Khazraj. So, prophet Muhammad had blood realtions with the Ansar.

Hashim was the son of Abd Manaf, who argued with his brother 'Abd ad-Dar over the inheritance. 'Abd ad-Dar was supported by their cousins Makhzum, Sahm, Jumah, their uncle Adi and their families. Abd Manaf contested his inheritance and was supported by their nephew Asad, their uncle Zuhrah ibn Kilab, their father's uncle Taym ibn Murrah, and al-Harith ibn Fihr. The effects of this conflict continued among their descendants, especially and affected the internal history of Mecca right up to Muhammad's time.

The conflict escalated under Hashim, who demanded that the rights be transferred from the clan of Abd ad-Dar to his clan. Those who supported Hashim and his brothers were the descendants of Zuhrah and Taym ibn Murrah, and all Qusay's descendants except those of the eldest line. The descendants of Makhzum and of the other remoter cousins maintained that the rights should remain in the family of Abd ad-Dar.

While assembled at the Ka'aba, Hashim and his brothers and all their allies dipped their hands in a bowl of rich perfume with nutmeg powder and swore that they would never abandon one another, rubbing their scented hands over the stone of the Ka'aba in confirmation of their pact. Hashim and his allies were thereafter known as the "Hilf al-Mutayyabun" ("Alliance of the Scented Ones"), while their rivals also swore an oath of union and organised themselves into the "Hilf al-Ahlaf" ("Alliance of the Confederates"). As neither side wanted a full-scale conflict, they reached a compromise whereby The Scented Ones retained control of the charity tax and the food and drink for pilgrims, where as the Confederates retained the keys to the Ka'aba and the running of the House of Assembly. Hashim's brothers agreed that he should have the responsibility of providing for the pilgrims. Their descendants in the clans named after them tended to keep this old alliance.

Hashim was accepted as the overall leader, with the responsibility of providing for the pilgrims in the Ka’aba precincts, with the support of his brothers 'Abd Shams and Muttalib, and his half-brother Nawfal. The only person who challenged Hashim's authority was Umayyah, the son of his brother 'Abd Shams, but he had no real support and shifted to live out his life in Syria. Makkah became the acknowledged capital of Arabia, and markets were established around the city to deal with all the business

</details><details><summary>

## Abd'al Muttalib (497–578)

</summary>

Shayba ibn Hāshim, better known as ʿAbd al-Muṭṭalib, ('Servant of Muttalib') was the fourth chief of the Quraysh tribal confederation. He was the grandfather of the prophet Muhammad.

Hashim died young while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born. Hashim had a younger brother Muttalib, who inherited the right of watering the pilgrims and levying the tax to feed them. Mutallb took Shaybah from Yathrib and brought him to Mecca. People thought that Shaybah is a servant of Mutallib, so started calling him **Abd'al Muttalib**.

Abd'al Mutallib is knows for the following important occasions that affected further development of Islam: 
1. Rediscovery of Zamzam. 
2. Vow to sacrifice Abdallah. 
3. Battle of the Elephant. 
4. Taking care of prophet Muhammad, when his parents died.

Abd'al Mutallib had 18 children. 12 sons.the priestess told hom to exchange Abdallah's life for 100 camels. 

### Early life
His father was Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf, the progenitor of the distinguished Banu Hashim, a clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. They claimed descent from Ismā'īl and Ibrāhīm. His mother was Salma bint Amr, from the Banu Najjar, a clan of the Khazraj tribe in Yathrib (later called Madinah). Hashim died while doing business in Gaza, before Abd al-Muttalib was born.

His real name was "Shaybah" meaning 'the ancient one' or 'white-haired' because of the streak of white through his jet-black hair, and is sometimes also called Shaybah al-Ḥamd ("The white streak of praise"). After his father's death he was raised in Yathrib with his mother and her family until about the age of eight, when his uncle Muttalib ibn Abd Manaf went to see him and asked his mother Salmah to entrust Shaybah to his care. Salmah was unwilling to let her son go and Shaybah refused to leave his mother without her consent. Muṭṭalib then pointed out that the possibilities Yathrib had to offer were incomparable to Mecca. Salmah was impressed with his arguments, so she agreed to let him go. Upon first arriving in Mecca, the people assumed the unknown child was Muttalib's servant, and started calling him 'Abd al-Muttalib ("servant of Muttalib").

### Chieftain of Hashim clan
When Muṭṭalib died, Shaybah succeeded him as the chief of the Hāshim clan. Following his uncle Al-Muṭṭalib, he took over the duties of providing the pilgrims with food and water, and carried on the practices of his forefathers with his people. He attained such eminence as none of his forefathers enjoyed; his people loved him and his reputation was great among them.

'Umar ibn Al-Khaṭṭāb's grandfather Nufayl ibn Abdul Uzza arbitrated in a dispute between 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib and Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, Abu Sufyan's father, over the custodianship of the Kaaba. Nufayl gave his verdict in favour of 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib. Addressing Ḥarb ibn Umayyah, he said:

Why do you pick a quarrel with a person who is taller than you in stature; more imposing than you in appearance; more refined than you in intellect; whose progeny outnumbers yours and whose generosity outshines yours in lustre? Do not, however, construe this into any disparagement of your good qualities which I highly appreciate. You are as gentle as a lamb, you are renowned throughout Arabia for the stentorian tones of your voice, and you are an asset to your tribe.

### Re-Discovery of Zam Zam Well
'Abdul-Muṭṭalib said that while sleeping in the sacred enclosure, he had dreamed he was ordered to dig at the worship place of the Quraysh. There he would find the Zamzam Well, which the Jurhum tribe had filled in when they left Mecca. The Quraysh tried to stop him digging in that spot, but his son Al-Ḥārith stood guard until they gave up their protests. 

After three days of digging, 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib found traces of an ancient religious well and exclaimed, "Allahuakbar!" Some of the Quraysh disputed his claim to sole rights over water, then one of them suggested that they go to a female shaman who lived afar. It was said that she could summon jinns and that she could help them decide who was the owner of the well. 

So, 11 people from the 11 tribes went on the expedition. They had to cross the desert to meet the priestess but then they got lost. There was a lack of food and water and people started to lose hope of ever getting out. One of them suggested that they dig their own graves and if they died, the last person standing would bury the others. So all began digging their own graves and just as Abdul-Muṭṭalib started digging, water spewed out from the hole he dug and everyone became overjoyed. It was then and there decided that Abdul-Muttalib was the owner of the Zam Zam well. Thereafter he supplied pilgrims to the Kaaba with Zam Zam water, which was considered sacred.

### Promise to sacrifice his son Abdullah
Al-Harith was 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's only son at the time he dug the Zamzam Well.  When the Quraysh tried to help him in the digging, he vowed that if he were to have ten sons to protect him, he would sacrifice one of them to Allah at the Kaaba. Later, after nine more sons had been born to him, he told them he must keep the vow. The divination arrows fell upon his favourite son Abdullah. The Quraysh protested 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib's intention to sacrifice his son and demanded that he sacrifice something else instead. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib agreed to consult a "sorceress with a familiar spirit". She told him to cast lots between Abdullah and ten camels. If Abdullah were chosen, he had to add ten more camels, and keep on doing the same until his Lord accepted the camels in Abdullah's place. When the number of camels reached 100, the lot fell on the camels. 'Abdul-Muṭṭalib confirmed this by repeating the test three times. Then the camels were sacrificed, and Abdullah was spared.

Later, Abdullah became the father of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   .

## Battle of Elephants (Year of the Elephant) 🐘

</summary>

> SHORT VERSION:
> 
> **The Ethiopian governor Abraha** envied pilgrims of Kaaba in Mecca and built a big Christian cathedral in Sanaa. But Arabs didnot change the direction of their pilgrimage. Then, Abraha gathered a large army with war elephants 🐘🐘🐘 and marched to destroy Kaaba.
> 
> Seeing a large army, people of Mecca left the city. Abdul Mutallib and the Quraish were convinced that Allah will protect the Kaaba. And Allah sent a flock of birds 🐦🐦🐦 that throwed stones from Hell to Abraha's army until the army was destroyed. 
> 
> This happened in the year the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was born and hence this event, it was called The Year of the Elephant.
> 
> The prophet Muhammad ﷺ   has received a surah about this event, **surah Al-Fil**.

The War of Elephants took place eight years before the death of Abd Al Muttalib. By then, he was the chieftan of the Quraysh tribe.

The Ethiopian governor of Yemen, Abraha al-Ashram, envied the reverence in which the Ka'bah was held by the Arabs. Being a staunch Christian, he built a big cathedral in Sanaa (the capital of Yemen) and ordered the Arabs to go there for pilgrimage instead. The order was ignored. Not only that; someone entered the cathedral and made it unclean. The wrath of Abraha knew no bounds. In his fury, he decided to avenge it by demolishing and desecrating the Ka'bah itself. He advanced with a large army towards Mecca.

There were many elephants in his army; he himself rode a huge elephant. It was an animal which the Arabs had not seen before, thus the year came to be known as 'Amul-Fil (the year of the elephant), and it started an era for reckoning the years in Arabia. This remained in use until the days of 'Umar ibn al ­Khattab when, on the advice of 'Ali ibn Abi Talib, he established the Islamic calendar and took the year of Hijra as the beginning.

When news of the advance of Abraha's army came, the Arabian tribes of Quraish, Kinanah, Khuza'ah and Hudhayl joined together to defend the Ka'bah. Abraha sent a small contingent towards Mecca to capture the camels and young people. The contingent captured many animals, including two hundred of 'Abdul-Muttalib's.

Meanwhile, a man from the tribe of Himyar was sent by Abraha to Quraish to advise them that Abraha had not come to fight them: his only aim was to demolish the Ka'bah. But if the Quraish resisted, they would be crushed. Then followed a frightening description of his huge army, which, admittedly, was much larger and better equipped than all the tribes put together.

'Abdul-Muttalib replied to this ultimatum in these words: "By Allah, we do not want to fight him. So far as this House (the Ka'bah) is concerned, it is the House of Allah; if Allah wants to save His House, He will save it, and if He leaves it unprotected, no one can save it."

Then 'Abdul-Muttalib, with 'Amr ibn Lu'aba and some other prominent leaders, went to see Abraha. Abraha was informed before hand of the prestige and position of 'Abdul-Muttalib. Also the personality of 'Abdul-Muttalib was very impressive and awe­inspiring. When he entered Abraha's tent, the latter rose from his throne, warmly welcomed him, and seated him beside him on the carpet. During the conversation, 'Abdul-Muttalib requested him to release his camels. Abraha was astonished. He said: "When my eyes fell upon you, I was so impressed by you that had you requested me to withdraw my army and go back to Yemen, I would have granted that request. But now, I have no respect for you. Why? Here I have come to demolish the House which is the religious center of yours and of your forefathers and the foundation of your prestige and respect in Arabia, and you say nothing to save it; instead, you ask me to return your few camels back to you?!"

'Abdul-Muttalib said: "I am the owner of the camels, (therefore, I tried to save them), and this House has its own Owner Who will surely protect it." Abraha was stunned by this reply. He ordered the camels to be released, and the deputation of Quraish returned.

On the second day, Abraha issued orders to his army to enter Mecca. 'Abdul-Muttalib told the Meccans to leave the city and to seek refuge in the surrounding hills. But he, together with some leading members of Quraish, remained within the precincts of the Ka'bah. Abraha sent someone to warn them to vacate the building. When the messenger came, he asked the people who their leader was. All fingers pointed towards 'Abdul-Muttalib. He was again invited to go to Abraha where he had a talk with him. When he came out, he was heard saying: "The Owner of this House is its Defender, and I am sure He will save it from the attack of the adversaries and will not dishonor the servants of His House."

'Abdul-Muttalib then took hold of the door of the Ka'bah and, crying to Allah, prayed in the following words (of poetry):

(O Allah! Surely a man defends his own home, therefore, Thou shouldst protect Thy Own House. Their cross and their wrath can never overcome Thy wrath. O Allah, help Thy Own people against the fellows of the cross and its worshippers).

Then he, too, went to the summit of the hill, Abu Qubays. Abraha advanced with his army. Seeing the walls of the Ka'bah, he ordered its demolition. No sooner had the army reached near the Ka'bah than an army of Allah appeared from the western side. A dark cloud of small birds 🐦🐦🐦 (known in Arabic as Ababil) overshadowed the entire army of Abraha. Each bird had three pebbles: two in its claws and one in its beak. A rain of the pebbles poured down from the birds, and in a few minutes, the whole army was destroyed. Abraha himself was seriously wounded; he fled towards Yemen but died on the way.

It is to this important event that Allah refers in Chapter 105:

    "Have you not considered, [O Muhammad], how your Lord dealt with the companions of the Elephant? Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray? And He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay, so He rendered them like straw eaten up."
    Quran, 105 Surah Al-Fil

This epoch-making episode happened in 570 A.D. It was in the same year that the Holy Prophet of Islam was born to Abdullah and Amina.

## Notable Monotheists

</summary>

There was a small group of monotheists present in Arabia on the eve of the rise of Islam. Its members did not worship idols, and they were the followers of the Prophet Abraham. 

Historic texts have preserved for us the stories of four wise men of Quraysh who withdrew from the people during one of the festivals of Quraysh that celebrated an idol. The men were Waraqah ibn Nawfal, ‘Ubaydullah ibn Jahsh, Uthman al- Huwayrith ibn Asad and Zayd ibn Amr.

Waraqah ibn Nawfal followed the Christians, and learned about their books from their scholars, until he gained some knowledge from the People of the Book. Uthmaan ibn al-Huwayrith went to Caesar (Qaysar), the ruler of the Romans and became a Christian, and was held in high esteem by Caesar.

Ubaydullah ibn Jahsh remained in his state of confusion until he became a Muslim, then he migrated with the Muslims to Abyssinia with his Muslim wife Umm Habeebah bint Abi Sufyaan. 

### Zayd ibn Amr
**Zayd ibn Amr ibn Nufayl** (died 605) was a monotheist who lived in Mecca shortly before Islam. 

> They said to one another: “You know, by Allah, that your people are not following anything (any true path), and they have deviated from the religion of their father Ibrahim (Peace be upon him);(Abraham). What is this stone that we circumambulate, which can neither hear nor see, and can neither cause harm nor bring benefit? O people! find yourselves a religion, for you are not following anything!” So they split up and traveled to different lands seeking the religion of Ibraahem.

He told priests and jews that this is not the religion of Ibrahim. Said ibn Zayd, his son, is one of the ten promised Paradise. 

He left his people and shunned the idols. He avoided dead meat, blood and the meat of animals that had been sacrificed to idols.

He said: 
> Allah created the sheep; He sent down water for it from the heavens and caused food to grow for it from the earth, then you slaughter it in a name other than that of Allah!

He spoke out against the practice of burying infant girls alive. He used to (rescue and) protect girls who were buried alive. He would say to a man who wanted to bury his daughter alive, “Don’t kill her, I will take care of her.” He would take the child, and when she grew up he would say to her father, “If you want I will give her to you, or if you want I’ll take care of her.“3 He denounced them and pointed out the enormity of their actions.

Asmaa’ bint Abi Bakr (may Allah be pleased with her) said, “I saw Zayd ibn ‘Amr standing, leaning back against the Ka‘ bah, saying, “O Quraysh! By Allah, no one among you is following the religion of Ibrahim (Peace be upon him); except me.“4

The Messenger ﷺ   said:
> I entered Paradise and I saw two gardens for Zayd ibn Amr. And when asked about Zayd, he ﷺ   said: "He will be gathered as a nation on his own, between me and ‘Eesa ibn Maryam."

### Waraqa ibn Naufal
**Waraqa ibn Naufal** was the paternal first cousin of Khadija bint Khuwaylid, the first wife of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was considered to be a hanif, who practised the pure form of monotheism in the pre-Islamic era. Waraqah presumably died in 610 CE, shortly after prophet Muhammad ﷺ   have received his first revelation.

Waraqah is revered in Islamic tradition for being one of the first hanifs to believe in the prophecy of Muhammad ﷺ   .

When told of Muhammad's first revelation (which is understood to be Sura 96:1-5), Waraqah acknowledged his call to prophecy as authentic. Tradition recounts Waraqah saying: "There has come to him the greatest Law that came to Moses; surely he is the prophet of this people".

Two different narrations from Aisha give these details.

> Aisha also said: "The Prophet returned to Khadija while his heart was beating rapidly. She took him to Waraqah bin Naufal who was a Christian convert and used to read the Gospel in Arabic. Waraqah asked (the Prophet), 'What do you see?' When he told him, Waraqah said, 'That is the same angel whom Allah sent to the Prophet Moses. Should I live till you receive the Divine Message, I will support you strongly.'"

> Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin Waraqah bin Naufil bin Asad bin 'Abdul 'Uzza, who, during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the Gospel in Hebrew as much as God wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqah, "Listen to the story of your nephew, O my cousin!" Waraqah asked, "O my nephew! What have you seen?" God's Apostle described whatever he had seen. Waraqah said, "This was the same one who keeps the secrets whom Allah had sent to Moses (Angel Gabriel). I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." God's Apostle asked, "Will they drive me out?" Waraqah replied in the affirmative and said, "Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you strongly." But after a few days Waraqah died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while.

# 9. History of Islam ☪
*******************************************

# 9.1. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ 

<details>
  <summary>Short Summary</summary>

**Muḥammad ibn Abd Allah ﷺ**(570 – 8 June 632 CE), is believed to be the seal of the messengers and prophets of God in all the main branches of Islam. The Quran, the central religious text of Islam, was revealed to Muhammad ﷺ    by God, and Muhammad ﷺ   was sent to restore Islam, which did not originate with prophet Muhammad ﷺ   but is the true unaltered original monotheistic faith of **Adam**, **Abraham**, **Moses**, **Jesus**, and other prophets. The religious, social, and political tenets that Muhammad ﷺ   established with the Quran became the foundation of Islam and the Muslim world.

Muhammad ﷺ   earned the title "al-Amin" (اَلْأَمِينُ, meaning "the Trustworthy"). At the age of 40 in 11 BH (610 CE), he have received his first verbal revelation in the cave called Hira, which was the beginning of the descent of the Quran that continued up to the end of his life. The Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet ﷺ    progressively according to the circumstances of the time over a period of 23 years. 

Muhammad ﷺ   was asked by God to preach the oneness of God in order to stamp out idolatry, a practice overtly present in pre-Islamic Arabia. Because of persecution of the newly converted Muslims, upon the invitation of a delegation from Medina (then known as Yathrib), prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and his followers migrated to Medina in 1 AH (622 CE), an event known as the Hijrah. A turning point in prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   life, this Hegira also marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar. 

In Medina, prophet Muhammadﷺ   sketched out the Constitution of Medina specifying the rights of and relations among the various existing communities there, formed an independent community, and managed to establish the first Islamic state. Despite the ongoing hostility of the Meccans, prophet Muhammadﷺ  , along with his followers, took control of Mecca in 630, and ordered the destruction of all pagan idols. In his later years in Medina, prophet Muhammadﷺ   unified the different tribes of Arabia under Islam and carried out social and religious reforms. By the time he died in about 11 AH (632 CE), almost all the tribes of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.

Muslims often refer to Muhammad as Prophet Muhammad, or just "The Prophet" or "The Messenger", and regard him as the greatest of all Prophets. He is seen by the Muslims as a possessor of all virtues. As an act of respect, Muslims follow the name of Muhammad by the Arabic benediction ﷺ   sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam, (meaning Peace be upon him), sometimes abbreviated as "SAW" or "PBUH".

Prophet Muhammadﷺ   is regarded as the final messenger and prophet by all the main branches of Islam who was sent by God to guide humanity to the right way (Quran 7:157). The Quran uses the designation Khatam an-Nabiyyin 33:40 (Arabic: خاتم النبين) which is translated as Seal of the Prophets. The title is generally regarded by Muslims as meaning that Muhammadﷺ   is the last in the series of prophets beginning with Adam. The belief that a new prophet cannot arise after Muhammad is shared by both Sunni and Shi'i Muslims. Believing Muhammadﷺ   is the last prophet is a fundamental belief in Islamic theology.

Prophet Muhammadﷺ   is a role model for all Muslims. 

Prophet Muhammadﷺ   was the possessor of moral virtues at the highest level, and was a man of moral excellence. He represented the 'prototype of human perfection' and was the best among God's creations. The 68:4 verse of the Quran says: `And you [Muhammad] are surely on exalted quality of character`. Consequently, to the Muslims, his life and character are an excellent example to be emulated both at social and spiritual levels. The virtues that characterize him are modesty and humility, forgiveness and generosity, honesty, justice, patience, and, self-denial.

According to biographers, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   lived a simple and austere life often characterized by poverty. He was more bashful than a maiden, and was rare to laugh in a loud voice; rather, he preferred soft smiling. Ja'far al-Sadiq, a descendant of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and an acclaimed scholar, narrated that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was never seen stretching his legs in a gathering with his companions and when he would shake hands, he would not pull his hand away first. It is said that during the conquest of Mecca, when prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was entering into the city riding on a camel, his head lowered, in gratitude to God, to the extent that it almost touched the back of the camel. He never took revenge from anyone for his personal cause. He maintained honesty and justice in his deeds.

### Meccan Period

<details><summary>

## **570**: The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   is born

</summary>

Muhammad ﷺ  , the son of 'Abdullah ibn 'Abd al-Muttalib ibn Hashim and his wife Aminah, was born in 570 CE, in the city of Mecca in the Arabian Peninsula. He was a member of the family of Banu Hashim, a respected branch of the prestigious and influential Quraysh tribe. Their ancestry reached the Prophet Ismael son of the Prophet Abraham, peace be upon them.

</details><details><summary>

## Childhood

</summary>

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was orphaned when young. Some months before the birth of prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , his father died near Medina on a mercantile expedition to Syria. When Muhammad ﷺ   was six, he accompanied his mother Amina on her visit to Medina, probably to visit her late husband's tomb. While returning to Mecca, Amina died at a desolate place called Abwa, about half-way to Mecca, and was buried there. Muhammad ﷺ   was now taken in by his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, who himself died when prophet Muhammad ﷺ    was eight, leaving him in the care of his uncle Abu Talib. In Islamic tradition, Muhammad's being orphaned at an early age has been seen as a part of divine plan to enable him to "develop early the qualities of self-reliance, reflection, and steadfastness". Some Muslim scholars see the story of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   as a spiritual parallel to the life of Moses, considering many aspects of their lives to be shared. The Quran said about Moses: 

    "I cast (the garment of love) over thee from Me, so that thou might be reared under My eye. ... We saved thee from all grief, although We tried thee with various trials. ... O Moses, I have chosen thee for Mine Own service"
    Quran 20:39-41

Taking into account the idea of this spiritual parallelism, together with other aspects of prophet Muhammad ﷺ  's early life, it has been suggested that it was God under Whose direct care prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was raised and prepared for the responsibility that was to be conferred upon him.

### Foster Mother

It was a custom of that time in Arabia to send children to be raised in the desert tribes. Women from rural areas would come to cities to take babies for breastfeeding and care. 

According to Arab custom, after his birth, infant Muhammad ﷺ   was sent to Banu Sa'ad clan, a neighboring Bedouin tribe, so that he could acquire the pure speech and free manners of the desert. There, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   spent the first five years of his life with his foster-mother Halima.

### Angel Jibril Occasion

When the prophet ﷺ    was 4, Jibril came in the form of a man and opened up his chest and took his heart out and took out the black portion and washed the heart with Zamzam water.

### Death of Aminah

After this occasion, Halimah returned 4-year old Muhammad ﷺ   to his mother Aminah. Aminah died soon. Abd al Mutallib took his grandchild Muhammad under his care.

### Life with Abd al-Mutallib

Muhammad ﷺ   was not even seven years old when his mother died. After his mother’s death, his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib assumed his guardianship. Because of his knowledge of the status of the child and his faith in him, Abdul-Muttalib treated Muhammad with more care and attention than his other children.
A group of the Medlaj Clan came to Mecca and when they saw Muhammad they said to his grandfather: ‘Take good care of him for we have never seen another of his station.’ Abdul-Muttalib told this to Abu Talib in his will and asked him to heed what they had said and take care of him. Muhammad was eight when his grandfather died, and he was taken into the care of his uncle Abu Talib.

### Death of Abd al-Mutallib

He became orphaned several times. His dad died, his mother died and his grandfather died.

Abu Talib, chief of the Bani-Hashim clan within the Quraysh tribe then became the guardian of Muhammad from his eighth year. Abu Talib went on to protect and serve the Messenger of Allah, defending him and honoring him throughout the testing times of his Prophethood, until the last breath of his life.

</details><details><summary>

## Early Manhood

</summary>

Muhammad grew up to become a fine young man. He became known for his excellent manners, and because of the honesty in his conduct and dealings he was referred to as **al- Sadiq** (The Truthful One) and **al-Amin** (The Trustworthy One).
 
The prophet Muhammad ﷺ    was a shepherd and worked for his uncle Abu Talib.

At around age 15, the heﷺ    participated in wars of Fijar. He was responsible for looking for arrows and bring them back. They reached a peace treaty.

### Hilf al-Fudul

At around 20, Muhammadﷺ   participated in the treaty of Mutayyabin. Az-Zubayr organized this pact in the house of Abdulla ibn Judhan. He was the youngest participant of the pact.

Hilf al-Fudul (League of the Virtuous, the Virtuous Pact, the Fadul Alliance) (Arabic: حلف الفضول translit: Hilf al-Fudool‎) was a pact made amongst the Arab tribes around Makkah after the Fijaar War prior to Prophethood. Fudul comes from Fadl which means nobility, superiority and virtue. The allegiance was also known as Hilf Al-Mutayyabeen (The Pledge of the Perfumed) because those who agreed placed their signatures by putting their hands in henna and then on the Kabaah.

#### Background
Al’Aas ibn Waail purchased merchandise from a merchant from the region of Zubaid in Yemen. Al’Aas being a chief and nobleman amongst the Quraysh decided not to pay and when the merchant approached the other Chiefs of Quraysh they sided with Al’Aas for being one of their own. The man shared his plight at the Kaaba asking the descendants of Faihr (Quraysh) to help him. Az-Zubair ibn Abdul-Muttalib became angry and called to his people, “Will no one help him!”

The community responded to Zuabir’s call and meeting was convened during the month of Dhul-Qai-dah at the home of Abdullah ibn Jud’aan. Members of Banu Hashim, Banu Zuhrah, Banu Muttalib, Banu Asad, and Banu Taim ibn Murrah who were present swore to Allah and pledged that they would stand together in support of any victim against the oppressor. The youngest attendees to the pact were Muhammad ibn Abdullah ﷺ   and Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq.

The Alliance proceeded to seize the merchandise from Al’Aas and returned it to its rightful owner.

> Allah’s Messenger ﷺ   spoke of his attendance at the forming of the allegiance after Prophethood. He said, “I witnessed a treaty at the home of Abdullah bin Jud’aan. If I am asked to attend such a meeting now, I would answer.”
> As-Seerah An-Nabawiyyah by Ibn Hishaam (1/134), and Fiqh us-Seerah by Al-Ghadbaan (pg.102)

> Also, ‘Abdu’r-Rahman ibn ‘Awf reported that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, “I was present with my uncles at the alliance of the perfumed (Hilf al-Mutayyabin). I would not wish to break it, even for red camels.”
> Saheeh As-Seerah An-Nabawiyyah by Ibraaheem Al-‘Alee (pg.59)

## Marriage to Khadeeja

</summary>

Hadija bint Khuwaylid was the richest woman in Mecca. She was married two times but her husbands died early.

Muhammad ﷺ   had no particular job at his early youth, but it was reported that he worked as a shepherd for Bani Saa‘d and in Mecca. At the age of 25, he went to Syria as a merchant for Khadijah bint Khuwaylid. Ibn Ishaq reported that Khadijah was a business-woman of great honour and fortune. She used to employ men to do her business for a certain percentage of the profits. The Quraysh were mostly tradespeople, so when Khadijah was informed of Muhammad, his truthful words, great honesty and kind manners, she sent for him. She offered him money to go to Syria and do her business, and she would give him a higher rate than the others. She would also send her hireling, Maysarah, with him. He agreed and went with her servant to Syria for trade. He took the caravan to Bosra outside Damascus. 

When he returned, Khadijah noticed, in her money, more profits and blessings than she used to. Her hireling also told her of Muhammad’s good manners, honesty, deep thought, sincerity and faith. All these impressed Khadijah and she realised that she had fallen in love with Muhammad and wished to marry him. Many prominent men had asked for her hand in marriage but she always spurned their advances. She disclosed her wish to her friend Nafisah bint Maniya, who immediately went to Muhammad and broke the good news to him. He agreed and requested his uncles to go to Khadijah’s uncle and talk on this issue. Subsequently, they were married. The marriage contract was witnessed by Bani Hashim and the heads of Mudar. Muhammad ﷺ   did not get married to anyone until she was passed away.

Some narrations say she was 40, ibn Iskhak reposrta that Khadija was 28. They had 6 children. 
* Al Kasim died at 6-8.
* Zaynab
* Um Kulthum
* Fatima
* Abdallah died in infancy. 

### Raising Ali

According to early historical sources, Ali was born in Mecca on 13 Rajab c. 600 CE. About the birthplace of Ali ibn Abi Talib, many sources, especially Shia ones, attest that Ali was the only person who was born inside the Kaaba. His father, Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib, was the leader of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh tribe. He was also Muhammad's uncle and raised him after his parents died. Later on, when Abu Talib became impoverished, Ali, who was five at the time, was taken home and raised by Muhammad and his wife, Khadija.

When Ali was nine or ten, Muhammad announced that he had received a divine revelation (wahy), and Ali believed him and professed to Islam. He was one of the first believers.

## Rebuilding of Kaaba

</summary>

When Muhammad ﷺ   reached the age of thirty, heavy rains came down in Makah and the walls of Kaaba fell and it was destroyed. The Quraishy wanted to rebuild and renovate it, thus all the chiefs of the different clans of Quraishy got together to discuss the affair, and decided to rebuild it and put a new roof.

At that time, Ceasar of Rome sent supplies to build a church in Yemen but the ship almost sank and ended up in Judda. So Quraish bought the marble stones and wood and the craftsmen.

It was rebuilt, but it could not be completed, as there were no enough funds. Thus, they left part of it not completed, and built a short wall to show the position of the Kaaba, and that area is known as Maqaam Ismail. They raised the walls to a height of about forty feet, more than what it was before and raised the door in such a way that one could only enter it by climbing up the steps.

Then came the time to put back the holy Black Stone (Hajar L-Aswad), here the different clans argued as to who would do that work. The Black Stone was put in its place by prophet Ibrahim AS when he and his son Ismail built the Kaaba. The Quraish argued and nearly fought a war, and remained in this situation for four days without coming to an agreement. One of the Quraishy elders by the name of Abu Umayyah bin L-Mughyra L-Makhzumy, the uncle of Khalid bin Waleed, said:

“O my people! Do not fight; instead find a solution to your problem which would satisfy all of you.”

They said: “We shall allow the first person who walks through that door to judgment us and solve our problem.”

As they were saying this, Muhammad ﷺ   walked in. Everyone rejoiced when they saw Muhammadﷺ  , because he had the highest reputation among Meccans as the most just and truthful.  When they saw him, they said: “Here is L-Amin, we have agreed he will judge us.”

They explained to him the problem. Muhammad ﷺ   took off his robe and lay it on the ground, then put the stone on it and said: “Let one person from each clan hold my robe and then lift it up, together.”

Therefore, they lifted it all together to the position where the stone was to be laid, and Muhammad ﷺ   placed it in its place with his hands and they were all happy and satisfied. The argument ended in peace, by Allah’s wisdom, Abu Umayyah had the brains to think quickly and guided his people, and Muhammad (SAW) had the ability to judge and put them in the right direction that led to a peaceful solution. Tribes rejoiced for handling this issue without bloodshed.

They changed the Kaaba:

1. They could not build the foundation as the original Kaaba which was a rectanlge.
2. made it higher
3. made the door higher
4. made the waterspout

> There is a hadith that reports prophet Muhammad ﷺ   said: "I would rebuild the Kaaba on the original pillar of Ibrahim if people werenot so new to Islam".

### Iqra: First Revelation 📗

<details><summary>

## **610**: First Surah of The Quran

</summary>

> Before the first revelation, Muhammadﷺ   began to hear the rocks and stones say salam in his path. He began having dreams about what would happen the next day. dreams lasted 6 full months. the prophet ﷺ    cut himself from society and worshipped Allah. As soon as he received the Revelation, he never left the society.

When Muhammad ﷺ    was nearly 40, he used to spend many hours alone in prayer and contemplating over the aspects of creation. He was concerned with the ignorance of divine guidance (Jahiliyyah), social unrest, injustice, widespread discrimination (particularly against women), fighting among tribes and abuse of tribal authorities prevalent in pre-Islamic Arabia. The moral degeneration of his fellow people, and his own quest for a true religion further lent fuel to this, with the result that he now began to withdraw periodically to a cave named Mount Hira, three miles north of Mecca, for contemplation and reflection. In the cave if you sit there you see the Kaaba. Islamic tradition holds that Muhammad during this period began to have dreams replete with spiritual significance which were fulfilled according to their true import; and this was the commencement of his divine revelation.

In the year AD 610, during one such occasion in the cave while Muhammad ﷺ   was in contemplation, the angel Gabriel appeared before him and said, "Read", upon which he replied, "I am unable to read". Thereupon the angel caught hold of him and embraced him heavily. This happened two more times after which the angel commanded Muhammad to recite the following verses:

    "Read! in the name of your Lord who created
    Man from a clinging substance.
    Read: Your Lord is most Generous,–
    He who taught by the pen–
    Taught man that which he knew not."
    Quran, Surah Al-Alaq

The revelation began on Monday one of the last 10 days of Ramadan (Laylatul Qadr).

Perplexed by this new experience, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   made his way home where he was consoled by his wife Khadijah. She believed that he saw the truth and said that Allah would not let him down. Khadijah also took him to her Nestorian cousin Waraqah ibn Nawfal. Waraqah was a Christian. Islamic tradition holds that Waraqah, upon hearing the description, testified to Muhammad's prophethood, and convinced Muhammad that the revelation was from God. Waraqah said: "O my nephew! What did you see?" When prophet Muhammad ﷺ   told him what had happened to him, Waraqah replied: "This is Namus (meaning Gabriel) that Allah sent to Moses. I wish I were younger. I wish I could live up to the time when your people would turn you out." Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   asked: "Will they drive me out?" Waraqah answered in the affirmative and said: "Anyone who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated with hostility; and if I should be alive until that day, then I would support you strongly." A few days later Waraqah died.

The initial revelation was followed by a pause and a second encounter with Gabriel when prophet Muhammad ﷺ   heard a voice from the sky and saw the same angel "sitting between the sky and the earth" and the revelations resumed with the first verses of chapter 74.

At-Tabari and Ibn Hisham reported that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   left the cave of Hira after being surprised by the revelation, but later on, returned to the cave and continued his solitude, though subsequently he returned to Mecca. Tabari and Ibn Ishaq write that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   told Zubayr:

> "when I was midway on the mountain, I heard a voice from heaven saying "O Muhammad! you are the apostle of Allah and I am Gabriel." I raised my head towards heaven to see who was speaking, and Gabriel in the form of a man with feet astride the horizon, saying, "O Muhammad! you are the apostle of Allah and I am Gabriel." I stood gazing at him moving neither forward nor backward, then I began to turn my face away from him, but towards whatever region of the sky I looked, I saw him as before."

Biographers disagree about the period of time between Muhammad's first and second experiences of revelation. Ibn Ishaq writes that three years elapsed from the time that Muhammad received the first revelation until he started to preach publicly. Bukhari takes chapter 74 as the second revelation however chapter 68 has strong claims to be the second revelation.

## **612**: Prophet Muhammad ﷺ    starts to preach

</summary>

After receiving a certain ayah, the prophet  ﷺ    gathered banu Hashim and made khutbah to them. Abu Lahab opposed saying that we have our fathers ways and who is this man to say the different.

Then the prophet ﷺ   climbed on top of Safa and made the message public. He asked do you trust me and they replied oh yes we havent heard from you any lie. And then he said the message to the tribes. Abu Lahab threw sand in the direction of the prophet ﷺ  . 

> Narrated Ibn Abbas: When the Verse: 'And warn your tribe of near-kindred (26:214), was revealed, the Prophet (Mohammed) ascended the Safa (mountain) and started calling, "O Bani Fihr! O Bani Adi!" addressing various tribes of Quraish till they were assembled. Those who could not come themselves, sent their messengers to see what was there. Abu Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet then said, "Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?" They said, "Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth." He then said, "I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment." Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) "May your hands perish all this day. Is it for this purpose you have gathered us?" Then it was revealed: "Perish the hands of Abu Lahab (one of the Prophet's uncles), and perish he! His wealth and his children will not profit him...." (111.1-5)

### First Muslims

Early converts to Islam included Muhammad's wife, Khadija, his cousin Ali, his adopted son Zayd, his nursemaid Umm Ayman, and his friend Abu Bakr.

Very few of the Quraysh gave weight to Muhammad's message; most ignored it and a few mocked him. According to Welch, early Qur'anic verses were not "based on a dogmatic conception of monotheism but on a strong general moral and religious appeal," further adding that the key themes of these Meccan surahs include the moral responsibility of man towards his creator: the resurrection of the dead, the Day of Judgement supplemented with vivid descriptions of the tortures in hell and pleasures in paradise, the wonders of nature and everyday life, the signs of God, and the proof of the existence of a greater power who will take into account the greed of people and their suppression of the poor. The foundations of early religious duties were also laid and included belief in God, asking for forgiveness of sins, offering frequent prayers, assisting others with emphasis on those in need, ejecting cheating and the love of wealth, chastity, and the prevention of femicide which was prevalent in early Arabia.

Abu Bakr was the first person to accept Islam upon hearing about it from Muhammad for the first time. Prior to that Abu Bakr was a monotheist and also avoided alcohol and idol worshipping. Abu Bakr is considered to be the first Muslim convert according to a majority of historical sources.

Ali ibn Abi Talib is known among the earliest and youngest Muslim converts. The early historian Ibn Ishaq and Tabari puts Ali Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law as the first child convert.

Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall describes how Abu Bakar, after embracing Islam, immediately urged his closest associates to do likewise. Among them were Talha, Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, Uthman ibn Affan, and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. Talha was said to have been one of the first eight converts.

There were three main groups of early converts to Islam: younger brothers and sons of great merchants, people who had fallen out of the first rank in their tribe or failed to attain it, and the weak, mostly unprotected, foreigners. Abu Bakr, who used to purchase slaves to set them free in accordance with Muhammad's principle of equality, attracted a large number of converts. Nevertheless, the number of these early converts remained small, and Muhammad concentrated on quietly building a small, but spiritually strong, community. Around 613, the Quran commanded Muhammad to `"admonish your nearest kinsmen,"`[Quran 26:214] initiating the phase of public preaching. One day, Muhammad climbed the As Safa mountain, and called out the tribal chiefs. After receiving assurances that the chiefs, who reportedly never heard Muhammad tell lies, would believe him, he declared the Oneness of God. Later Muhammad organized dinners in which he conveyed and advocated the substance of his message. At these events, Muhammad met fierce opposition from one of his uncles, Abu Lahab, while others such as Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib and al-'Abbas accepted him.

Other early converts: Abdullah ibn Masood, Uthman ibn Affan, Khabbab.

ibn Masood as a youth worked as a shepherd for Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt. He first met prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and Abu Bakr while watching his flocks when they were "fleeing from the idolators". They asked him for milk, but Abdullah said he could not steal from his employer. According to Masʿūd, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   then asked for an unmated ewe and stroked its udder, whereupon milk poured out. Abdullah immediately asked to be taught "some of these words", and prophet Muhammad ﷺ   began to teach him the Qur'an. Abdullah later said that he learned 70 suras from prophet Muhammad ﷺ  .

## Persecution of first Muslims

</summary>

In the early days of Islam at Mecca, the new Muslims were often subjected to abuse and persecution. The persecution lasted for twelve years beginning from the advent of Islam to Hijrah. Muhammad preached Islam secretly for three years. Then, he openly preached Islam, resulting in public prosecutions. Muhammad and his followers were first belittled and ridiculed, then persecuted and physically attacked for departing from traditional Mecca's tribal ways.

When Islam began to spread, the Makkans asked Abu Talib, the uncle and guardian to Muhammad, to hand him over to them for execution but he repeatedly refused. Abu Talib acted fast and called on the members of Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib to meet at the Ka'bah and convinced them to pledge that they would protect their clansman, Muhammad. Abu Lahab, another of the Prophet's uncles and enemy, refused to take the pledge and declared he was on the side of the Quraysh.

Prophet Muhammad's uncle Abu Talib was one of the famous poets of Quraish and he was the chief of Banu Hashim. Banu Hashim people started to press on Abu Talib to stop his preaching or give him to other tribes. They couldn't touch the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , if Abu Talib doesn't give the permission. Abu Talib tried to talk to prophet Muhammad ﷺ   but eventually said: "Do what you will, my nephew, for Wallahi, I will not come to you again to stop your preaching".

All Quraish tribe people came to Abu Talib trying to exchange sons between tribes, so that he can give them prophet Muhammad ﷺ   , but Abu Talib refused. It was the whole Quraish against Abu Talib but he protected the prophet ﷺ    till his last day. However it is believed that he didn't accept islam.

Slaves Sumayyah bint Khabbab, and her husband Yasir, were tortured to death by their master Abu Jahl.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was protected somewhat by the influence of his family. Abu Lahab's wife, Umm Jamil, would regularly dump filth outside his door. An eyewitness mentioned that the worst thing he ever saw the Quraysh doing to Muhammad was that a person from Quraysh clutched his clothes.

Abu Lahab's wife, Umm Jamil (Abu Sufyan's sister), had made it a practice to cast thorns at Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   door in the night so that when he or his children came out of the house at dawn, they should run thorns in the foot.

> Narrated Ibn Abbas: Abu Lahab said, "May you perish! Is it for this that you have gathered us?" So there was revealed: 'Perish the hands of Abu Lahab'.

    Perish the two hands of Abu Lahab (an uncle of the Prophet), and perish he!
    His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained.
    He will be burnt in a Fire of blazing flames!
    And his wife too, who carries wood (thorns of Sadan which she used to put on the way of the Prophet (Peace be upon him), or use to slander him).
    In her neck is a twisted rope of Masad (palm fibre).
    Quran, Surah Al-Masad

Narrated Abdullah that while prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was in the state of prostration, surrounded by a group of people from Quraysh pagans. 'Uqba bin Abi Mu'ait came and brought the intestines of a camel and threw them on the back of prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . The prophet ﷺ   did not raise his head from prostration until Fatima (i.e. his daughter) came and removed those intestines from his back.

Umayya Bin Khalf brutally tortured Bilal upon learning that Bilal had embraced Islam. Umayya would put a rope around Bilal's neck and drag him in the streets. During this torture, Bilal would shout with his beautiful voice "Ahadun Ahad! Ahadun Ahad!" meanint "the One! the One!". In the burning hot desert heat, Umayya used to wrap Bilal in raw cow's hide. Due to the great stench of rotting hide, Bilal would find it difficult to breathe. Umayya would also chain Bilal heavily, lay him on hot sand, and put heavy stones on him. After such punishments, news of this slave reached some of Muhammad's companions who told Muhammad of the slave. Muhammad then sent Abu Bakr. Eventually, Abu Bakr negotiated a deal with Umayyah to purchase Bilal and emancipate him from slavery.

Abu Lahab used to fling stones at prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . He forced his two sons to divorce Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum, who were daughters of prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . People used to spit and throw dust at prophet ﷺ  . Makkan polytheists used to grab the hair of Uqbah and twist his neck. The slaves were often tortured by their masters for apostasy.

> Narrated Jundub bin Sufyan: Once Muhammad ﷺ   became sick and could not offer his night prayer (Tahajjud) for two or three nights. Then a lady (the wife of Abu Lahab) came and said, "O Muhammad! I think that your satan has forsaken you, for I have not seen him with you for two or three nights!" On that Allah revealed: 'By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens, your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither forsaken you, nor hated you.' (93.1-3)

Abdullah ibn Masood was the first to recite the Quran besides the prophet ﷺ  .

The most famous poet of Quraish (Bani Maghzum) was Al Walid al Mughira. He was the chief of the Banu Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe and he was the father of Khalid ibn Al-Walid. his vice was abu Jahl. Al Walid heard the recitation and was mesmerized but Abu Jahl said that there will be no respect from his people until he says something bad about the recitation. Allah ST send ayahs about Al Walid that we gave him money and many sons he says there is special type of magic.

    and I gave him extensive wealth, and sons present before (his) eyes.
    Quran 74:12-13

Walīd ibn al-Mughīra was one of the Quraysh leaders who were indirectly mentioned in several verses of Quran. He was one of the five principal offenders of Muhammad, the others being al-Aswad ibn al-Muṭṭalib ibn Asad, al-Aswad ibn ʿAbdu Yaghūth, al-ʿĀṣ ibn Wāʾil ibn Hishām and al-Ḥārith ibn al-Ṭulāṭila (from Banu Khuzāʿa).

Walid was a personage of great influence among the Quraysh. After he heard Muhammad reciting, Walid went to Quraysh and said: "I have just heard Muhammad's words, which for sure are neither a human's nor a jinn's. They are euphonious and relaxing, like a tree full of reachable fruits. They are of the highest quality and cannot be out-perfected." He told them, "The time of the fair has come round again, and representatives of Arabs will come to you and they will have heard about Muhammad. So agree upon one opinion without dispute, so that none of us will give the lie to the other." He recommended that they call Muhammad a sorcerer who has brought a message by which he separated a man from his father, brother, wife or family. The Quraysh accordingly warned the people attending the fair about Muhammad's doing. So, according to a Muslim historian, "Allah revealed verses 11–25 in Sura 74 concerning al-Walid."

    He pondered and suggested. Death onto him! How [ bad ] is the suggestion he has put forward! Again, death unto him! How [ bad ] is the suggestion he has put forward! Then he looked [ to those around him,] then he frowned and scowled, then turned his back, and waxed proud, then said, "This is nothing but traditional magic; this is nothing but saying of a mortal.

Prophet Muhammad said "Abu Jahl is Firaun of my ummah". Abu Jahl tortured slaves and boycotted muslim businessmen. At that time, the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    made dua against 7 people including Abu Jahl untill their faces turn pale. Abdullah ibn Masood said that he saw all these seven people in the battle of Badr and all of them were dragged to the Pit.

Ammar, Sumayah, Bilal, Khabbab.

Khababb was a swordsman. His back was in bruises.

> Narrated Khabbab bin Al-Arat:
> We complained to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) (of the persecution inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Kaaba, leaning over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, "Would you seek help for us? Would you pray to Allah for us?" He said, "Among the nations before you a (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty.

House of Al Arkham was a secret meeting place. It was near mount Safa because many people go there and no suspision would be raised.

## First Meccan Surahs of the Quran

</summary>

The First Meccan period refers to the first period in which Muhammad started receiving revelations. The First Meccan surahs are chapters that have been revealed throughout that period. They reflect the public setting in which they seem to have been shared and due to their structure and length, they seem to be presented in a manner that would be very easy to memorize and pass along orally, not to mention that many of the surahs seem to be used during early liturgies. They are relatively shorter than other chapters in the Quran but are more diverse in terms of structure. 

Compared to other later surahs, the surahs of the First Meccan Period employ more rhymes despite their shorter length. They rank from being very short, a paragraph of less than five verses (for example surah 97, 103, 105, 108 and 111) to being organized in clusters of two (surahs 81, 91), three (surahs 82, 84, 86, 90, 92) or four verses (surahs 85, 89). Some of these surahs also take on a balanced tripartite structure that begin and conclude with. The major theme of these surahs revolves around presenting to humanity how obvious the existence of God is through the use of oath formulas involving the power of nature in an emphatic tone. We especially see the surahs reference destroyed civilizations, declaring their destruction to be the will of God. A stress is put on God being the creator of Earth and Heaven and everything that lies in between and also His unreachable generosity. 

In addition, certain surahs generally talk about ethics and values human beings should have, especially the fact that human beings should be humbled by God's power, they should not pursue an extravagant life, they should be loving and sharing, most particularly with the poorer. Last but not least these surahs contain eschatological prophecies. Although not elaborated as in later surahs, these prophecies appear with a threatening tone to make people generally know about the existence of the Day of Judgement and all that it encompasses (surah 103, 68, etc.), but also, they contain some of the more visual explanations of Heaven.

## Rabbis test prophet Muhammad ﷺ   (Surah Al-Kahf) 

</summary>

Arab Muslim historian and hagiographer, Ibn Ishaq, reported in his traditional book (oral traditions) of biography of Muhammad, Sirat Rasul Allah that the 18th surah of the Qur'an (which includes the story of Dhu l-Qarnayn) was revealed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad by God on account of some questions posed by rabbis residing in the city of Medina – the verse was revealed during the Meccan period of Muhammad's life. According to Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad's tribe, the powerful Quraysh, were greatly concerned about their tribesman who had started claiming prophethood and wished to consult rabbis about the matter. The Quraysh sent two men to the rabbis of Medina, reasoning that they had superior knowledge of the scriptures and about the prophets of God. The two Quraysh men described their tribesman, Muhammad, to the rabbis.

The rabbis told the men to ask Muhammad three questions:
They [the rabbis] said, "Ask him about three things which we will tell you to ask, and if he answers them then he is a Prophet who has been sent; if he does not, then he is saying things that are not true, in which case how you will deal with him will be up to you. Ask him about some young men in ancient times, what was their story for theirs is a strange and wondrous tale. Ask him about a man who traveled a great deal and reached the east and the west of the earth. What was his story and ask him about the Ruh – what is it? If he tells you about these things, then he is a Prophet, so follow him, but if he does not tell you, then he is a man who is making things up, so deal with him as you see fit."

According to Ibn Ishaq, when Muhammad was informed of the three questions from the rabbis, he said that he would have the answers in the morning but did not say "if God wills it". For fifteen days, Muhammad waited eagerly for the revelation. Muhammad did not answer the question until then. Doubt in Muhammad began to grow amongst the people of Mecca. Then, after fifteen days, Muhammad received the revelation of al-Kahf as an answer to the questions.

Al-Kahf ( الكهف, al-kahf; The Cave) is the 18th chapter (sūrah) of the Quran with 110 verses (āyāt).

The story of believers falling asleep in a cave for a long time is present also in the Christian tradition, see [Sleepers in the Cave](#sleepers_in_the_cave).

## 615: First Migration of Muslims to Abyssinia

</summary>

At the 5th year of da'wa the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   said that there's a Hhristian king in Abyssinia who is just and would let you worship Allah without hardship. 11 men and 4 women emigrated. among them was Uthman with Ruqayah, Abdurrahman ibn Awf, Abu Salamah, Um Salamah.

In the early days of Islam when Muslims were tortured, persecuted, and humiliated in many ways, a few Muslims emigrated to take refuge in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) that was ruled by Ashamah Negus (also known as al-Najashi), a Christian king. The prophet had known him as a fair ruler and thus had permitted the followers of Islam to take refuge in his kingdom. Makkah’s Quraish, who at the time were amongst the foremost in persecuting the new Muslims could not tolerate the Muslims living peacefully in the Christian kingdom. Hence, they made a last ditch effort to get those Muslims extradited to Makkah and sent two of their strongest envoys to demand their extradition.

Those envoys were Amr bin Al-As and Abdullah bin Abi Rabia (the two embraced Islam a few years later). The two envoys took valuable gifts for the king and his clergy in the hopes of convincing the king to return the new Muslims. The pagan envoys demanded the Muslims’ extradition on grounds that they had abandoned the religion of their forefathers, and their leader (Muhammad) was preaching a religion different from theirs and from that of the king.
On hearing the claims against Muslims that the envoys had presented, the Christian king summoned the Muslims to his court. The Muslims selected Jafar bin Abi Talib to speak on their behalf. With silence in the court, Jafar bin Abi Talib stood up and addressed the king in the following words:>> >  

> “O King! we were plunged in the depth of ignorance and barbarism; we adored idols,
> we lived in unchastity,
> we ate the dead bodies,
> and we spoke abominations,
> we disregarded every feeling of humanity,
> and the duties of hospitality and neighborhood were neglected;
> we knew no law but that of the strong,
> when Allah raised among us a man,
> of whose birth, truthfulness, honesty, and purity we were aware;
> and he called to the Oneness of Allah ,
> and taught us not to associate anything with Him.
> “He forbade us the worship of idols;
> and he enjoined us to speak the truth,
> to be faithful to our trusts,
> to be merciful and to regard the rights of the neighbors and kith and kin;
> he forbade us to speak evil of women,
> or to eat the substance of orphans;
> he ordered us to flee from the vices,
> and to abstain from evil;
> to offer prayers,
> to render alms, and to observe fast.
> “We have believed in him,
> we have accepted his teachings and his injunctions to worship Allah, and not to associate anything with Him, and we have allowed what He has allowed, and prohibited what He has prohibited.
> “For this reason, our people have risen against us,
> have persecuted us in order to make us forsake the worship of Allah and return to the worship of idols and other abominations.
> They have tortured and injured us, until finding no safety among them; we have come to your country, and hope you will protect us from oppression.” 
> [Reference: Ar-Raheeq Al-Makhtum]

Najashi asked to recite the Revelation. Jagfar recited surah Maryam. Najashi was moved and said "I'm not going to hand out these people".
Amr ibn 'As said ask them about what they think about Jesus. Jagfar went to Najashi again and said that Jesus AS was a righteous prophet. It turned out that Najashi has not believed in Trinity.  

There is a narration that after migrating to Medina the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    wrote Najashi inviting him to islam and Najashi replied back saying I am a Muslim and I believe in you and if you tell me I will come to Medina and serve you. 

When the Najashi died, the prophet gathered people and they prayer Janazah. It was the only time janazah was prayed without a body.

Muslims remained in Abyssinia for 10-11 years. The prophet ﷺ   told them to return only after the Battle of Badr and some time. Allah knows best but there are reports that the prophet ﷺ   kept Abyssinia in mind as a backup plan if it does not work out in Medina.

Umi Habiba's husband died and she was left alone in Abyssinia so the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    proposed to her. Najahsi himself gave the mahr.

Second wave of migration to Abyssinia was around 100 people.

## Hamza and Umar convert to Islam

</summary>

Abu Jahl was cursing the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and his fathers. And the woman of Banu Hashim got insulted and women came to Hamza and said "What kind of uncle are you, your nephew is insulted and noone defends him!. The whole Mecca saw it". Muhammad's uncle, Hamza, a man of his own age, was reputed to be the strongest and most active of the Quraysh, their champion in war and sports. He spent most of his time hunting in the hills. Hamza marched to Abu Jahl and smacked him in the face and said "How dare you insult him! I am also following his religion." These words just came out in anger. Hamza went home and made dua for God to guide him.

Next morning he came to his nephew and they talked and Hamza converted to Islam. The prophet Muhammad ﷺ   finally had support from senior of his tribe and the Quraish had to turn down. It was the 6th year of da'wa. Only after 3 days Umar ibn Al-Khattab converted.

Umar before Islam liked to drink. The pubs were closed so he went at night to the Kaaba and he heard the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   praying in front of the Kaaba and heard the recitation. So Umar wanted to beat him but stopped and listened to the surah Al Haqqa. He was amazed. The meccan surahs are eloquent and powerful. He began to think where is this coming from. He went home. 

Abu Jahl promised 100 camels for the one who gets rid of the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . Umar decided to do it and took his sword and he met Nu'ayn who has just converted to Islam and when he learned the intention of Umar he said "Have you lost your mind? and if you want to know, go fix your own family first. your sister and brother in law just accepted Islam." So, Umar marched to his sister's house and heard the recitation of the Quran. 

Khabbab was assigned to teach the Quran to Fatima ibn Khattab. He wanted to punch her husband Said ibn Zayd but punched his sister, which calmed him down. Umar asked to let him see what they are reading. Umar could read and write. Khabbab ibn Al Aratt was a swordsman who's back was burned by his owners and who helped to turn Umar. He said "O Umar, may you be the one who the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   prayed for". 

They made Umar take ghusl and read surah Ta Ha. Umar asked where is the prophet Muhammadﷺ   and he went to the house of Al Arkham still holding his sword. 

Sahaba saw Umar and were scared. Hamza said to let him in. Umar said he came to convert and the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   said loudly "Allahu Akbar" (Allah is The Greatest). They went together with Hamza, Umar and 40 people to pray in the mosque of Haram.

> Abdullah ibn Mas'ud said we were never able to pray in the Haram until Umar converted.

The prophet ﷺ   gave Umar a name "Al-Faruq" after they for the first time went all together to Haram to pray.

Umar personally informed Abu Jahl. This is one the funniest stories of early Islam. How Umar came to Abu Jahl to inform him that he has accepted Islam knowing that Abu Jahl will be distressed by the good news.

## **610**: Boycott of Muslims

</summary>
Then the Quraysh plotted amongst themselves about the companions of the Messenger of Allah who had entered Islam with him from amongst their tribes. Each tribe pounced upon any of its own who were Muslims, tormented them and forced them out from their religion.

Abu Talib protected the Messenger of Allah, and seeing what the Quraysh were doing to the sons of Hashim and Abdul-Muttalib, he called upon them to protect the Messenger of Allah just as he was protecting him. So they gathered with him and stood up with him, except for Abu Talib's brother Abu Lahab and his sons who had assisted the Quraysh against the Prophet.

Then the Quraysh openly decided to kill the Messenger of Allah. When this news reached Abu Talib he gathered the sons of Hashim and Abdul-Muttalib and took the Messenger of Allah to his quarter and protected him from those who sought to kill him.

The Quraysh imposed total and complete embargo against the Prophet and his followers in all its forms; social, economic, political, etc. No citizen of Mecca was allowed to buy from or sell to them, no one was allowed to marry anyone of them, or even befriend or socialize with them, not even help them. Nor would a peace settlement be accepted from them ever, nor they would be shown any mercy until they had handed over the Messenger of Allah to be killed.

The Quraysh agreed to draw up a document to this effect, and one of them wrote this document in his own hand, which subsequently was afflicted by paralysis, and then they hung the document inside the Kabah.

The Prophet and many of his followers, and members of the Hashim clan withdrew to Abu Talib and entered the Abu Talib’s Quarter known as Sheb Abu Talib, which had become their virtual open-top prison. Their condition deteriorated as time went by, and although some friends of sympathizers managed to smuggle in some help to the Muslims, but this was few and far between. There they remained in the quarter for three years until they were exhausted. The voices of the children could be heard from the quarter crying of hunger.

The Quraysh also increased the pressure on those who had entered Islam but had not entered the quarter. The trials became grave and the Muslims were severely shaken. It is reported that Ali son of Abu Talib used to secretly leave the quarter in disguise and fetch foodstuff to the besieged, carrying it into the quarter on his back.

Some people gathered and said we need to gather and stop the boycott. At the same time the prophet ﷺ   said Abu talib that the treaty has been eaten by termites. All except bismika.. 
So they opposed Abu Jahl

The clan of Hashim then felt safe enough to emerge from their quarter and once more mingle with the people. This was in the tenth year of the noble prophethood, circa 620 CE.

At this time, Amr ibn 'As came from Yemen to mecca, the prophet told him to go back and wait for his victory. then he comes to Medina.

Also, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari came to the Prophet  ﷺ  . Abu Bakr showed him the house. The prophet Muhammad  ﷺ    told him to go back to his tribe and preach the onennes of GOd and doing good deeds and wait until he hears about the victory of Muslims and until then don't tell about your religion here. Abu Dhar goes to Kaaba and proclaims that he is a muslim, then he gets savagely beaten. People stop only after they realize that they will get revenge from Al-Ghifari if he dies.

Abu Dharr comes home and starts to preach. Afte Hijra he comes to Medina with a lot of followers from his tribe.

in the 7th year the Quraish gathered and decided to kill the prophet  ﷺ   . 
Abu Talib didnot agree and the boycot started. all marriages with banuHashim were rejected, all business transactions ceized.

Banu Hashim and Banu Muttalib went to the valley outside Mecca.
the Quraish wrote the treaty and hanged it inside the Qaaba.

Mut'wa would send food to the valley secretly. also Hakim ibn Hizam would send food.
TDuring the Hajj season the prophet  ﷺ    would leave the valley and continue da'wa and tried to find new converts.

Boycott lasted 2 or 3 years. 
There was a severe famine and they realized that this is because of the dua of Muhammad  ﷺ   .

### The Annulling of the Boycott
“The Banu Hashim and the Banu al-Muttalib were in the Shi'b (mountain hideout) as the Quraysh had made a covenant to ostracize them. Then some members of the Quraysh itself took steps to annul the boycott against them. None took more trouble in this than Hisham Bin Amr ... for the reason that he was the son of a brother to Nadla b. Hashim b. Abd Manaf by his mother and was closely attached to the Banu Hashim. He was highly esteemed by his people.

I have heard that when these two clans were in their Shi'b, he used to bring a camel laden with food by night and then, when he had got it to the mouth of the alley, he took off its halter, gave it a whack on the side, and sent it running into the alley to them. He would do the same thing another time, bringing clothes for them.

He went to Zuhayr B. Abu Umayya B. Al-Mughira whose mother was Atika daughter of Abdul Muttalib, and said: ‘Are you content to eat food and wear clothes while you know of the condition of your maternal uncles? They cannot buy or sell or inter-marry. By God, if they were the uncles of Abu'l-Hakam b. Hisham (Abu Jahl), and you asked him to do what he has asked you to do, he would never agree to it.’

He (Zuhayr) said, ‘Confound you, Hisham, what can I do? I am only one man. By God, if I had another man to back me, I would soon annul it.'

He said, ‘I have found a man – myself.' ‘Find another,' said he.

So Hisham went to Al-Mutim B. Adiy and said, ‘Are you content that two clans of Banu Abd Manaf should perish while you look on consenting to follow Quraysh? You will find that they will soon do the same with you.'

He (Mutim) made the same reply as Zuhayr and demanded a fourth man.

So Hisham went to Abu’l Bukhtari B. Hisham who asked for a fifth man, and then to Zama’a B. Al-Aswad B. Al-Muttalib, who asked for a sixth man, and reminded him of their kinship and duties. He asked whether others were willing to cooperate in this task. He gave him the names of the others. They all agreed to meet at night near Hujun, above Makkah, and when they did, they bound themselves to take up the question of the document until they had secured its annulment.

On the following day, when people got together, Zuhayr put on a robe, went round the Kaaba seven times; then came forward and said: ‘O people of Mecca, are we to eat and clothe ourselves while the Banu Hashim perish, unable to buy or sell? By God, I will not rest until this evil boycotting document is torn up!

Abu Jahl shouted: ‘You lie. It shall not be torn up.'

Zama'a said: “You are a greater liar; we did not want this document even when it was first drafted and signed. Abu'l Bukhtari said, ‘Zama'a is right. We were not satisfied with this document when it was written, and we are not satisfied with it now.'

Al-Mutim added: “You are both right, and anyone who says otherwise, is a liar. We take Allah to witness that we dissociate ourselves from the whole idea and what is written in the document.” Hisham spoke in the same sense, and supported his friends.

Then al-Mutim went up to the document to tear it in pieces. He found that worms had already eaten it except the words, “In Thy Name O Allah.” This was the customary formula of the Quraysh to begin their writing. The writer of the deed was Mansur b. Ikrima.”

Ten years had passed since Muhammad, may God bless him and his Ahlul-Bait, had first proclaimed his mission. The boycott of the Quraysh had failed to produce the intended result. The members of Banu Hashim were defiant, and their morale was high. It was just as unthinkable for them, at the end of the siege, as it had been at the beginning, to surrender Muhammad, their darling, to his enemies.

Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib returned to their homes in Makkah after three years. During these three years, the vast fortunes of Khadija and Abu Talib had run out. They had to make, as it were, a new beginning in life, by putting their blocks into place – one by one.

</details><details><summary>

## Death of Hadijah and Abu Talib (Year of Sorrow)

</summary>

It was less than six months after the end of boycott when Abu Talib passed away. Then the Prophet's wife Lady Khadijah also died only three days after Abu Talib according to some accounts. The Messenger of Allah was very saddened and named this year the 'Year of Sorrow'.

The loss of Abu Talib and Lady Khadijah dealt a severe blow to the Prophet at a time when he needed these two most. The death of Abu Talib cleared the last hurdle for the Quraysh, and if the presence of Abu Talib imposed certain limits and drew some red lines for the Quraysh that they could not cross, now his death left them free to do to the Prophet what was the unthinkable while Abu Talib was alive.

With the death of Abu Talib, the trials meted out by his tribe to the Messenger of Allah grew more barbaric and audacious. Once when the Prophet was praying by the Kabah, one of the idolaters approached and violently tried to strangle him.

The Quraysh encouraged the foolish to throw dirt on the Prophet's face and head. They used to throw filth, blood and thorns at his door. Ummayah ibn Khalaf used to insult the Prophet until his face became red but still the Prophet would not say anything to him. When a fool threw the dirt in the face of the Messenger of Allah, he entered his house with the dirt still on his head. Fatimah began to clean the dirt from his head. She was crying and the Messenger of Allah saying: “Do not cry my daughter, for Allah will protect your father.” He also said: “The Quraysh could not harm me until Abu Talib died.”

Two of the most committed defenders of Muhammad's message, his wife Khadija and his uncle Abu Talib, died. With the death of Abu Talib, the leadership of the clan of Banu Hashim was passed to another uncle of Muhammad, Abu Lahab, an inveterate enemy of Muhammad and Islam. Abu Lahab soon withdrew the clan's protection from Muhammad, placing Muhammad in mortal danger since the withdrawal of clan protection implied that the blood revenge for his killing would not be exacted. Muhammad then tried to find a protector for himself in another important Arabian city close to Mecca, Ta'if, but his effort failed as he was pelted with stones in the city.

### Incident of Taif

More than ten years had passed since prophet Muhammad ﷺ   had first begun to preach Islam. His success in these ten years had been rather modest, limited as it was to the conversion of fewer than 170 men and women in Makkah. But after the death of his wife, Khadija, and his uncle, Abu Talib, it appeared that the Quraysh would wrest even that limited success from his hands.

Makkah had proved inhospitable to Islam and it occurred to the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   that he ought, perhaps to try to preach the new faith in some other city. The nearest city was Ta’if, 70 miles in the south-east of Makkah, and he went there in late 619. Zayd bin Haritha went with him.

In Ta’if, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   called on the three chiefs of the local tribes, and invited them to abandon their gross idolatry, to acknowledge the Oneness of God, to repudiate man-made distinctions of high and low, and to believe in the equality and brotherhood of all men.

The chiefs of Ta’if were a conceited and arrogant crew, and they did not want even to listen to prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . They greeted him with mockery and ridicule and set upon him the idlers and the louts of the city. They pelted him and Zayd with clods and rocks. Wounded and covered with blood, prophet staggered out of Ta’if.

Once he was outside the city walls, he almost collapsed but a certain gardener took him into his hut, dressed his wounds, and let him rest and recuperate until he felt strong enough to resume his journey across the rough terrain between Ta’if and Makkah.

But when prophet Muhammad ﷺ   arrived in the environs of Makkah, he sensed that he could not reenter his native city now that his uncle, Abu Talib, was not there to protect him. Pagan hostility toward him had reached the flash point. He realized that if he entered Makkah, he would be killed

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   could not enter his hometown, and there was no other place to go to. What was he to do?

In this extremity, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   sent word to three nobles in the city asking each of them to take him under his protection. Two of them refused but the third one – the gallant Mutim ibn Adiy – responded to his signal of distress. It was the same Mutim who had, earlier, flouted the chiefs of Quraysh by tearing into pieces their covenant to boycott the Banu Hashim, and had brought the two clans of Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib from the Sh’ib Abu Talib back into the city.

Mutim ordered his sons, nephews and other young men of his clan to put on their battle-dress. He then marched, in full panoply of war, at their head, out of the city. He brought prophet Muhammad ﷺ   with him, first into the precincts of the Kaaba where the latter made the customary seven circuits, and then escorted him to his home.

## Night of Jinn 

</summary>

Once the Prophet ﷺ  visited Taif to invite the people to Islam. He wanted to talk to the people of the town to invite them to Islam but they all shut their doors on his face and rejected him. Zaid bin Haris (May Allah be pleased with him) was his Companion. Both of them went to their leader, who rejected them as well. He asked his slaves and young boys to drive them away.. They threw stones at them to drive them out of the town. Both of them were injured. Our Prophet ﷺ  bled so much that his shoes were filled with his blood and got stuck to his feet. The Prophet ﷺ  felt dizzy .

Zaid (May Allah be pleased with him) said, “I helped the Prophet ﷺ  to leave the village and we rested under a tree.” Both men then returned to Makkah. On the way, at Watane Nakhla, Prophet ﷺ  woke up to offer Tahajjud and recited the Qur’an.

The Jinns of that time had noticed that they could not cross over the heavens and hear the conversations of the angels anymore, rather they were chased by meteors and were driven away. Their leader instructed them to find out the reason so they wandered around. There was a valley called Nasibi which was inhibited by Jinns. These Jinns passed by the place at night when they heard the recitation. The group heard the melodious recitation of our Prophet ﷺ and were entranced. Without the knowledge of our Prophet ﷺ  that group of Jinn accepted Islam. It was then the above verses of Surah Jinn were revealed. The point to be noted is that the humans of Taif rejected the Message of Allah but the Jinn accepted it. Allah truly does not let the efforts of the Believers go in vain.

Once the Prophet ﷺ   was sitting with his Companions. He had to go to attend the call of nature. He went a bit farther and did not return for a long time. The Companions were worried about his absence and feared that he had been abducted. They searched for him the whole night. In the morning, the Prophet ﷺ returned. When the Companions inquired, he replied, “I was called by a group of Jinns over that mountain, who had embraced Islam and wanted to learn the religion from me. It took me the whole night to teach them”. This night is called “Laylatul Jinn”. The Companions then went along him to the place and saw burnt sticks and ash which indicated that food was cooked that night. Therefore, it is essential to believe that the Prophet ﷺ was sent even to the Jinn.

Dawud reported from 'Amir who said:

> I asked 'Alqama if Ibn Mas'ud was present with the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   on the night of the Jinn (the night when the Prophet met them). He (Ibn Mas'ud) said: No, but we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   one night and we missed him. We searched for him in the valleys and the hills and said. He has either been taken away (by jinn) or has been secretly killed. He (the narrator) said. We spent the worst night which people could ever spend. When it was dawn we saw him coming from the side of Hiri'. He (the narrator) reported. We said: Messenger of Allah, we missed you and searched for you, but we could not find you and we spent the worst night which people could ever spend. He (the Holy Prophet) said: There came to me an inviter on behalf of the Jinn and I went along with him and recited to them the Qur'an. He (the narrator) said: He then went along with us and showed us their traces and traces of their embers. They (the Jinn) asked him (the Holy Prophet) about their provision and he said: Every bone on which the name of Allah is recited is your provision. The time it will fall in your hand it would be covered with flesh, and the dung of (the camels) is fodder for your animals. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: Don't perform istinja with these (things) for these are the food of your brothers (Jinn).

Prophet Mohammed ﷺ is the Prophet for human-kind as well as Jinns.

There are two places where Qur’an mentions communication between the Prophet ﷺ and the Jinns.

In Surah al-Jinn, Allah reveals that the Jinn, too, listened to the communications of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and the Qur'an, and that some of them accepted Deen and became Muslims. One verse on the subject reads:

    Say: "It has been revealed to me that a band of the jinn listened and said, 'We have heard a most amazing Recitation. It leads to right guidance so we believe in it and will not associate anyone with our Lord.'" 
    Surah al-Jinn: 1-2

In that same Surah, Allah also reveals that some Jinn are actually Muslims:

    [The Jinn said] "And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. Anyone who believes in his Lord need fear neither belittlement nor tyranny. Some of us are Muslims and some are deviators. Those who have become Muslim are those who sought right guidance." 
    Surah al-Jinn: 13-14

    When the servant of Allah stands calling on Him, they almost swarm all over him. 
    Surah al-Jinn: 19

Yet another verse recounts that when the Prophet ﷺ   gave guidance regarding Deen, the jinn would gather around him and listen carefully:

    And [mention, O Muhammad], when We directed to you a few of the jinn, listening to the Qur'an. And when they attended it, they said, "Listen quietly." And when it was concluded, they went back to their people as warners. Surah Ah’kaf- 29

These verses make it clear that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was sent as a Prophet for all mankind and the jinn. The Qur'an is a guide for both mankind and the Jinn.

## Isra 'Al-Miraj ✨

</summary>

Source: [Al-Isra wa Al-Miraj: History of Miraculous Night Journey](https://muslimhands.org.uk/latest/2019/04/al-isra-wal-mi-raj-the-story-of-the-miraculous-night-journey)

The events of Isra and Miʿraj are mentioned briefly in the Quran and then further expanded and interpreted within the hadith. Isra means travel at night. Al Isra -- the night journey. Al miraj means the mechanism of rising high.

Miraj is a personal gift to the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   from Allah ST.

Al-Isra’ wal-Mi’raj took place during a time when the Prophet (saw) was facing intense hardship and pain. The Quraysh, who were his tribe and his family, constantly ridiculed, humiliated and oppressed the Prophet (saw) and his followers. Moreover, the Prophet (saw) had just faced the Year of Sorrow (’Aam al-Huzn), during which he (saw) lost his beloved wife Khadijah (ra), and his uncle Abu Talib, who was his protector and ally.

In addition to all these burdens, when the Prophet (saw) had travelled to Ta’if to spread the Islamic message, the people of Ta’if had rejected him in the most cruel way, sending their children into the streets to stone him until he left the city.

Having gone through so much grief and suffering, the Prophet Muhammad (saw) was given a truly beautiful and comforting gift. He was transported not only to the Sacred Sanctuary and through the skies, but ultimately into the Divine Presence, the source of all comfort and hope. One of the most important lessons of Al-Isra’ wal-Mi’raj, therefore, is that ‘with every hardship [there will be] ease’ (The Noble Qur’an, 94: 5).  

There are so many narrations about Isra and Miraj. Almost half of the hadith from the Meccan period are about Isra and Miraj.

When isra ocurred? Most commentators say a year before Hijrah. Aisha narrated that Hadija dies before the salah became fard. That means Miraj happened within 1.5 years before Hijrah. 

Isra and Mi'raj, a supernatural journey to Jerusalem (Isra) and ascension to the Seven Heavens (Mi'raj), which has been accomplished in one night along with the angel Gabriel. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   toured heaven and hell, and spoken with earlier prophets, including Adam, Ibrahim, Musa, and Isa. Ibn Ishaq, author of first biography of Muhammad, presents this event as a spiritual experience while later historians like al-Tabari and Ibn Kathir present it as a physical journey. Some western scholars of Islam hold that the oldest Muslim tradition identified as a journey traveled through the heavens from the sacred enclosure at Mecca to the Bayt al-Ma'mur (a celestial recreation of the Kaaba); others identify it as Muhammad's journey from Mecca to the Bayt al-Maqdis in Jerusalem.

Within the Quran, chapter (surah) 17 al-Isra, was named after the Isra', and the first verse contains a brief description. There is also some information in a later verse, and some scholars say a verse in surah an-Najm also holds information on the Isra and Miʿraj.

    Glory to Him who made His servant travel by night from the sacred place of worship (Al-Masjid Al-Haram) to the furthest place of worship (Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa), whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him some of Our signs. He alone is the All Hearing, the All Seeing.
    Remember when We said to you that your Lord encompasses mankind in His knowledge. Nor did We make the vision We showed you except as a test to people, as also the accursed tree in the Quran.
    Quran 17:60

    His sight never wavered, nor was it too bold.
    And he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord.
    Quran 53:13–18

### Al-Isra’: From the Ka’bah to Al-Aqsa

Jibreel came to the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and took him to Kaaba. He prayed two raqah then Jibreel opened up his chest and washed his heart in a golden bowl inside of which was Zamzam. Probably this was done to prepare the prophet for the Isra.

When the Prophet ﷺ   was sleeping in the house of Umm Hani (ra) in Makkah he said, ‘the roof of my house was opened and the Angel Jibril [as] descended’ (Bukhari). Scholars reconciling between various narrations, say the Prophet (saw) was then taken to the Hijr, the semi-circular wall of the Ka‘bah, where the Prophet ﷺ   said that Jibril (as), ‘opened my chest, and washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom and faith, and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it’. [Bukhari]

The Prophet ﷺ   continued, ‘I was then brought a white beast which is called al-Buraq [from the Arabic word barq, meaning lightning], bigger than a donkey and smaller than a mule. Its stride was as long as the eye could reach’. [Muslim]

It is narrated by Anas (ra) that Buraq was, ‘saddled and reined, but he shied from him (saw). So Jibril [as] said to him, “Is it from Muhammad ﷺ   that you do this? For nobody has ridden you who is more honourable to Allah than him!” He said, “Then he started sweating profusely”’. [Tirmidhi]

At several points along the journey, Jibra’eel (as) stopped Buraq and told the Prophet (saw), ‘Dismount and pray’. The first stop was at ‘the place of emigration’ i.e. Madinah - and soon after this night the Prophet (saw) would meet the Ansar and migrate to Madinah. The second stop was at Mount Sinai, where Allah (swt) revealed the Torah to Musa (as). The third stop was at Bethlehem, where ’Isa (as) was born.

The fourth stop was the grave of Musa (as), ‘I happened to pass by Musa [as] on the night of my Night journey by the red sandhill whilst he was standing praying in his grave’ (Muslim). We know that his grave is located, ‘a stone’s throw’ away from the holy land of the Blessed Masjid Al-Aqsa (Bukhari). This incident clearly shows us an example of what the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   said about Prophets (as) after they pass away that, ‘The Prophets are alive in their graves praying’ (Abu Ya‘la).

### Arriving at Al-Aqsa

Finally, the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   arrived in the holy city of Al-Quds (Jerusalem) and he said, ’When we reached Bait al-Maqdis [literally ‘the holy house’ another name for the Blessed Masjid Al-Aqsa] Jibril (as) pointed with his finger causing a crack in the rock, and he tied the Buraq to it [at the western wall of the noble sanctuary]’ (Tirmidhi). Waiting inside were all 124,000 Prophets (as). Jibra’eel (as) led the Prophet ﷺ   to the front, and he (saw) led them all in prayer in this blessed space.

Some narrations indicate that the Prophet ﷺ   prayed ‘two units of prayer’ (Muslim) to greet the Masjid (known as Tahiyyat al-Masjid). This is one of the first examples of this established Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ  . It is also mentioned that Jibril (as) called the Adhan (call to prayer) before this practice was even established later in Madinah and that the angels from the heavens descended to pray behind all the Prophets in this sacred place.

When the Prophet ﷺ   completed the prayer, he said, ‘someone said, “Here is Malik (as), the keeper of the Hell, so convey Salams to him”. So, I turned to him, but he preceded me in Salams’ (Muslim).

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ   also said, ’The Prophets were presented to me, and Musa (as) was a thin man, it was as if he was from the men of Shanu’ah [a Yemeni tribe]. And I saw ’Isa ibn Maryam (as), and the closest of the people in resemblance to him from those I have seen, is ‘Urwah ibn Mas‘†d (ra). And I saw Ibrahim (as), and the closest of the people in resemblance to him, from those I have seen, is your companion [meaning himself]. And I saw Jibril [as], and the closest of the people in resemblance to him, from those I have seen, is Dihyah (ra)’ (Tirmidhi).

[Ibn Majah] Part of what the Prophets (as) discussed after praising Allah was about ‘the Hour’. Both Ibrahim (as) and Musa (as) stated that they ‘did not have any knowledge of it’. Whilst ’Isa (as) ’mentioned the Dajjal (anti-Christ) and said,

    “I will descend and kill him, then the people will return to their own lands and will be confronted with Gog and Magog, who will, “swoop down from every mound” 
    Qur’an, 21:96 

Following this, the Prophet ﷺ   said, ‘Then I came out and Jibril (as) brought me a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk. Then I chose the milk, and Jibril (as) said, “You have chosen the natural state (Fitrah)”’ (Muslim).

The dominant opinion is that the Prophet ﷺ   alongside Jibril (as) then proceeded to the Noble Rock (as-Sakhrah al-Musharrafah) that is currently housed by the holy Dome of the Rock Masjid at the centre of the noble sanctuary (al-Haram ash-Sharif) of the Blessed Masjid Al-Aqsa. He (saw) ascended into the heavens for the next part of this incredible journey, the Mi‘raj, the Ascension.

### Al-Miraj

Source: [Al-Miraj: The Story of Ascention to the Skies](https://muslimhands.org.uk/latest/2021/03/al-isra-wal-miraj-the-story-of-the-ascension-to-the-skies)

    "He [saw] certainly saw some of his Lord’s greatest signs".
    The Noble Qur’an, 53:18

The word Al-Mi’raj is a noun of instrument in Arabic morphology, which literally means ‘an instrument you use to ascend’. 

The Prophet ﷺ  , ’saw the wide-eyed maidens of Paradise at the left of the Rock [at the Dome of the Rock Masjid]. He greeted them and they returned his greeting. Then he asked them something and they replied with an answer that cools the eyes. Then the Prophet ﷺ   was brought the ladder by which the spirits of the children of Adam (as) ascend. Creation never saw a more beautiful object. It had alternate stairs of silver and gold and came down from the Highest and Amplest Garden of Paradise, Jannat al-Firdaws. It was encrusted with pearls and surrounded with angels on its right and left’. [The Prophet’s Night Journey and Heavenly Ascent by Sayyid Muhammad ibn Alawi al-Maliki]

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ   also said that, ‘a ladder was brought to me finer than any I have ever seen. It was that to which the dying man looks when death approaches’. [The Life of Muhammad ﷺ   by Ibn Ishaq]

Now let’s see what happened when the Prophet ﷺ   accompanied by Jibril (as) ascended into the layers of sky.
* The Lowest Sky: Adam
* The Second Sky: Yahya and Isa
* The Third Sky: Yusuf
* The Fourth Sky: Idris
* The Fifth Sky: Harun
* The Sixth Sky: Musa
* The Seventh Sky: Ibrahim

#### The First Sky
Allah ascended the Prophet ﷺ   from the Dome of the Rock through the skies, where he not only saw many miraculous sights and numerous angels, he also met the past Prophets (as). Along the way, he ﷺ   was greeted with excitement and delight, as his arrival had been much-anticipated.

It is hard to imagine how he ﷺ   must have felt upon meeting his brothers (as), all of whom had gone through trials and difficulties, as they met him with the warmth and love his own tribe had isolated him from. He was greeted with the words, ‘Welcome O pious Prophet and pious brother!’ (Bukhari). (Adam (as) and Ibrahim (as), however, welcomed him as a ‘pious son’).

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ   said: ’Then he ascended with us to the heaven [first layer of the sky and end of the known universe]. Jibril [as] then asked the (gate of heaven) to be opened (by knocking on one of its doors). [Bukhari]

It was said, “Who are you?” He said, “Jibril [as]“.

It was said, “And who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad ﷺ  “.

It was said, “Has he been sent for?” He said, “He has indeed been sent for”.

And it (the door of the heaven) was opened for us and suddenly I was with (the Prophet) Adam [as]. Then he welcomed me and supplicated for good for me’. [Muslim]

In other narrations we gain more details of the meeting of the Prophet ﷺ   and the Prophet Adam (as):

’There we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, ”Welcome O pious Prophet and pious son!” (or in another narration, ”Welcome you are amongst family, O my son! What an amazing son you are!” [Bukhari]).

I asked Jibril [as], “Who is he?” He replied, “He is Adam [as] and the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and when he looks towards his left, he weeps”’. [Bukhari]

#### The Second to Sixth Sky

Then the Prophet ﷺ   continued to ascend the layers of sky with Jibril (as). Again, permission was sought to enter, and the angelic guards were delighted and welcomed the Messenger of Allah (saw).

At the second sky, he met the maternal cousins, the Prophets Isa (as) and Yahya (as).

At the third sky, the Prophet (saw) met the Prophet Yusuf (as) whom he described as having ‘been given half of (world) beauty’ [Muslim]. The Messenger of Allah (saw) had himself been blessed with all beauty, ma sha’ Allah!

At the fourth sky, the Prophet (saw) met the Prophet Idris (as) whose soul was taken there, and he is praised in the Qur’an: ‘We raised him to a lofty position’. [The Noble Qur’an, 19:57]

At the fifth sky, he met the Prophet Harun (as); and in the sixth sky, he met Prophet Harun’s younger brother, the Prophet Musa (as).

Some narrations mention that Musa (as) was seen crying and a voice was heard saying, ‘What makes you cry?’ He said, ’My Lord, this is a young man whom You have sent after me (as a Prophet) and his Ummah will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my Ummah’. [Muslim]

Musa has the second largest ummah after the prophet Muhammad  ﷺ   .

At each one of these levels, these Prophets (as) welcomed the Prophet (saw) and supplicated good for him saying, ‘Welcome O pious Prophet and pious brother!’ [Bukhari]

#### The Seventh Sky
At the seventh sky, the Prophet (saw) met his greatest ancestor, the Prophet Ibrahim (as) who was ‘reclining his back against al-Bait al-Ma‘mur. And there enter into it seventy thousand angels every day, never to return to it (again)’. [Muslim]

(Bait al-Ma’mur literally means ‘the much-visited House’. It is the heavenly Ka‘bah directly above the one on earth).

Like Adam (as), Ibrahim (as) greeted the Prophet (saw) saying, ‘Welcome O pious Prophet and pious son!’ [Bukhari]

In another narration, Ibrahim (as) conveyed his salaams to the Ummah of the Prophet (saw) and advised us that, ‘Paradise has pure soil and delicious water, and that it is a flat treeless plain, and that its seeds are (saying), SubhanAllah (Glory be to Allah), Alhamdulillah (All praise belongs to Allah), La ilaaha ill-Allah (There is no god but Allah), and Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)’. [Tirmidhi]

Ibrahim AS said we must plant the plants in Jannah ourselves, every dhikr becomes a tree 🌳 in Jannah.

Only two people have titile of halilullah: Ibrahim AS and the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  .

The last two verses of surah Al Bakarah were given on the 7th heaven when the prophet ﷺ    was there.

#### The Lote Tree
The Prophet ﷺ   carried on his journey, reaching the Furthest Lote Tree. The Arabic word for this is Sidrah al-Muntaha [The Noble Qur’an, 53:14]. The Prophet ﷺ   described this vast tree in great detail.

> ‘[Its] leaves were like elephant ears and its fruit like big earthenware vessels’. [Muslim]
> ‘Then when it was covered by the Command of Allah, it underwent such a change that none amongst the creation has the power to praise its beauty’. [Muslim]
> ‘A rider will travel in the shade of one of its branches for a hundred years,’ or ‘a hundred riders will seek to shade themselves with its shade’. [Tirmidhi]
> The tree is surrounded with ‘golden butterflies’. [Tirmidhi]
> He further said: ‘many a colour had covered it which I do not know (i.e. the colours of this tree were indescribable)’. [Muslim]
> He also stated that, ‘There terminates everything that ascends from the earth, and everything that descends from above’. [Tirmidhi]

    The ˹Prophet’s˺ heart did not doubt what he saw.
    How can you ˹O pagans˺ then dispute with him regarding what he saw?
    And he certainly saw that ˹angel descend˺ a second time
    at the Lote Tree of the most extreme limit ˹in the seventh heaven˺—
    near which is the Garden of ˹Eternal˺ Residence—
    while the Lote Tree was overwhelmed with ˹heavenly˺ splendours!
    The ˹Prophet’s˺ sight never wandered, nor did it overreach.
    He certainly saw some of his Lord’s greatest signs.
    Quran 53:11–18

The Sidrat al-Muntaha (سِدْرَة ٱلْمُنْتَهَىٰ, , lit. 'Lote Tree of the Farthest Boundary') is a large lote tree or Sidr tree that marks the utmost boundary in the seventh heaven, which no one can pass. It is called Sidrat al-Muntaha because the knowledge of the angels stops at that point, and no one has gone beyond it except the Messenger of Allah ﷺ  . During the Isra and Mi'raj, Muhammad traveled with the angel Gabriel to the tree (where the angel stopped) beyond which Allah (God) instructed prophet Muhammad ﷺ   about the five daily prayers.

#### The Divine Meeting
At the end of this journey, the Prophet ﷺ   was brought into the Divine Presence, the ultimate source of strength and relief. It is impossible to imagine the beauty of this scene, or how loved, honoured and humbled the Prophet ﷺ   must have felt.

We do not know a great about what was privately discussed between Allah and His beloved ﷺ  , with Allah simply stating:
    
    "Then Allah revealed to His servant [saw] what He revealed". 
    The Noble Qur’an, 53:10

The Prophet ﷺ   mentioned, 
> ‘Then Allah revealed to me what he revealed to me and then He made obligatory for me fifty prayers every day and night’. [Muslim]

It was here that Allah gave this Ummah the gift of compulsory Salah, a daily source of strength to Muslims because it gives us the opportunity to communicate with Allah and draw closer to Him - it is the believer’s ascension! We know through the Prophet Musa’s (as) intervention and advice that fifty prayers were eventually reduced to five, but still rewarded as fifty, subhanAllah.

The prophet Muhammad ﷺ   would pray 50 rakat every day.

#### Returning Home

Finally, the Prophet ﷺ   was taken back down to the Blessed Masjid Al-Aqsa and returned to Makkah on the Buraq.

As he was transported home, he saw various caravans heading towards Makkah, which he would later describe to the Quraish as proof that he really had made this miraculous journey. Allah even displayed Bait al-Maqdis to the Prophet (saw), while the Quraish were cross-examining him in the Hijr of the Ka‘bah [Bukhari]. The entire journey had taken place in a small portion of a night, and there were many who would mock the Prophet ﷺ   for making such a claim.

For the Muslims, however, the story was a source of wonder and hope, as it continues to be for us today. On this night, the best of creation ﷺ   was given the honour of travelling to various blessed places on earth, then ascending the levels of sky and being finally welcomed into the Divine Presence! All this to honour the beloved Prophet ﷺ   and `‘to show him some of Our signs!’` [The Noble Qur’an, 17:1]

## Praying 5 times a day become obligatory

</summary>

Praying 5 times a day was made obligatory when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was taken on his night journey and ascended to heaven.

Salah (صلاة, plural salawat, lit. 'prayer'), also known as namāz (Persian: نماز) and also spelled salat, are prayers performed by Muslims. Facing the qibla, the direction of the Kaaba with respect to those praying, Muslims pray first standing and later kneeling or sitting on the ground, reciting prescribed prayers and phrases from the Quran as they bow and prostrate themselves in between. Salah is composed of prescribed repetitive cycles of bows and prostrations, called rakat (sing. rak'ah). The number of rak'ahs, also known as units of prayer, varies from prayer to prayer. Ritual purity and wudu are prerequisites for performing the prayers.

The daily obligatory prayers collectively form the second of the five pillars in Islam, observed five times every day at prescribed times. These are Fajr (observed at dawn), Zuhr (observed at noon), Asr (observed late in the afternoon), Maghrib (observed after sunset), and Isha (observed at dusk). Salah can be performed either in solitude, or collectively (known as jama'ah). When performed in jama'ah, worshippers line up in parallel rows behind a leader, known as the imam.

Prayer was made an incumbent duty on Muslims ever since the very early days of Islam. The Prophet’s night journey took place in the tenth year after the start of his message. In those ten years many surahs of the Qur’an were revealed, and in many of them we read instructions to the Prophet and Muslims to attend to their prayers and to pay their zakah. Indeed the most essential duties in Islam, and in all earlier divine religions, are belief in God’s oneness, prayer and zakah. If you read Surah 73, Al-Muzammil, which is one of the earliest to be revealed, you find an order to the Prophet and his companions to spend much of the night in prayer and worship. This remained obligatory for a whole year, when the obligation was relaxed, and night worship was made voluntary. Earlier prophets were also commanded to offer prayers, as this is clear in the Qur’an.

The Prophet says: “A religion that does not include a prayer duty is devoid of goodness.” In the Prophet’s life history we read that Abu Talib once saw Ali praying and he asked him what he was doing. Ali explained that it was the prayer the Prophet ordered. Abu Talib said: “Since he orders only what is good, obey him.”

What was imposed on Muslims then before the Prophet’s night journey? Scholars mention that most probably it was in the same form we pray now, but the obligation was only two prayers a day, one during the day and one after nightfall.

## 622: Young pilgrims invite the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   to Yathrib

</summary>

> Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   kept preachin Islam. In one occasion, Arabs from Yathrib meet the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and invite him to stay in their city.
> 
> Yathrib at that time have just started recovering after interglabe wars. Many conservatiry old dwellers died in the war so majority of the popultation were young and they were eager to acquire something new.

Yathrib was a town in an oasis about 250 miles in the north of Makkah. In A.D. 620, six Yathribites visited Makkah for pilgrimage. A fortuitous meeting with prophet Muhammad ﷺ   led to their conversion to Islam. They told him that they had left Yathrib in a state of simmer and that it could erupt anytime into warfare. But they expressed the hope that God would restore peace to their city through His Messenger. They also promised to return to Makkah and to meet him in the following year.

This was the beginning of Islam in Yathrib.

When these six new Muslims returned to Yathrib, they talked with their folks and friends about Islam, and found them willing, even eager to listen. A year later, when the season of pilgrimage arrived, twelve citizens of Yathrib, including the original six, visited Makkah. Among them there were two women also.

They met the Apostle of God ﷺ   at Aqaba. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   briefed them on the Articles of Faith in Islam, and all of them accepted Islam. At the same time, they also gave him  ﷺ   their pledge of loyalty. This is called the First Pledge of Aqaba.

These Muslims solemnly assured the prophet Muhammad  ﷺ   that:
* they would never associate partners with Allah,
* they would not worship anyone except Him;
* they would never rob or steal;
* they would never kill their female infants;
* they would never revile others;
* they would never defame women;
* they would always be chaste and pure;
* they would obey Allah and His Messenger;
* and they would be faithful to him at all times.

The neophytes requested the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   to send some teacher with them to Yathrib to teach them Qur’an and the precepts of Islam. He ﷺ   sent Mus'ab ibn Umayr, one of his uncles (Mas'ab was the cousin of his father), with the group to propagate Islam in Yathrib. Mas'ab's mission was successful, and many families in Yathrib accepted Islam.

This was the first time that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   had chosen an official. Professor Margoliouth says that Mas'ab ibn Umayr was the first choice of an official in Islam.

### The Second Pledge of Aqaba
In A.D. 622, seventy-five citizens of Yathrib came to Makkah in the season of the pilgrimage. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   gave them audience at the same spot at Aqaba where he had met the group of twelve the year before. These 75 men and women also accepted Islam. They gave him their pledge of loyalty, and invited him to Yathrib.

prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   uncle, Abbas ibn Abdul Muttalib, was with him on this occasion. He is reported to have said to the “hosts” from Yathrib: “Muhammad is held in high esteem by his own people. If you can stand by him through thick and thin, take him with you to Yathrib; if not, then abandon the whole idea.”

One of the leaders of the Yathribites was Bera'a ibn Ma'roor. He said: “When we were children, our favorite toys were swords and spears.” Another chief, Abul Haithum, interrupted him, and said: “O Messenger of God! What will happen when Islam becomes great and strong? Will you then leave Yathrib and return to Makkah?”

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   smiled and said: 

> "No. Your blood is my blood and my blood is your blood. From this day you are mine and I am yours, and I shall never part company with you."

The Yathribite Muslims were satisfied by the assurance given to them by prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , and they returned to Yathrib to spread Islam among their folks. Islam began to make steady progress in Yathrib. When it appeared that the new faith had found a haven in that city, the Apostle suggested to the victims of persecution in Makkah to emigrate there. Following his suggestion, Muslims began to leave Makkah, in small groups, and to settle in their new homes in Yathrib.

The Second Pledge of Aqaba is a landmark in the history of Islam. It was the “anchor” on which the frail vessel of Islam came to rest at last, after being buffeted for thirteen years in the turbulent seas of paganism in Arabia.

## 622: 70 families move to Yathrib

</summary>

Despite all the precautions that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and the people of Yathrib had taken, Quraysh found out the secrets behind this treaty. Consequently, they endeavored to arrest the treaty signers. Since those who paid homage to the Holy Prophet had left Mecca in time, they could flee to safety except for one who was arrested.

After the departure of the people of Yathrib, Quraysh increased their pressure on Muslims, because they realized that the Holy Prophet had safeguarded a stronghold in Yathrib; they therefore increased their pressures on Muslims. Once again, life in Mecca had become intolerable. For this reason, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   ordered Muslims to emigrate to Yathrib, telling them, “Go to Yathrib; God will provide you with brethren and a safe place.” For two and a half months, (i.e. from the middle of Dhu’l-Hijjah up to the end of ¯afar) Muslims gradually headed for Yathrib despite all hardships that Quraysh put in their way. Hence, no Muslim remained in Mecca except for prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , Abu-Bakr, Ali and some others. In the history of Islam, those Muslims who emigrated to Yathrib are called the muhajirin (Emigrants) and those who helped out prophet Muhammad ﷺ   in Yathrib are called the ansar.

Most Muslims migrated at night fearing Quraish resistance, but Umar is reported to have left openly during the day saying: "Anyone who wants to make his wife a widow and his children orphans should come and meet me there behind that cliff." Umar migrated to Medina accompanied by his cousin and brother-in-law Saeed ibn Zaid.

> Story of emigration of Suhaib al-Rumi. He was taken as a slave by Byzantine soldiers as a young boy, and 20 ears he lived in Byzantine lands as a slave speaking Greek and forgot Arabic. He escaped from bondage and headed to Mecca. Abdullah ibn Judan took him as mawliya. Gradually Suhaib engaged in trade and became rich. He was not tortuted very harshly. Before hijra to Medina the Quraish tried to stop him but he threatened them with arrows. 
>
> The Quraish said: "You came to Mecca weak and poor and you have acquired what you have acquired.."
>
> "What would you say if I leave you my wealth?" interrupted Suhayb. "Would you get out of my way?" "Yes," they answered.
>
> Suhayb described the place in his house in Mecca where he had left the money, and they allowed him to go. When Suhayb reached Quba, just outside Medina, prophet Muhammad ﷺ    him approaching and said, "Your transaction has been fruitful, O Abu Yahya. Your transaction has been fruitful." He repeated this three times. Suhayb's face beamed with happiness as he said: "By God, no one has come before me to you, Messenger of God, and only Jibril could have told you about this."

## 622: Assasination Attempt and Hijra

</summary>

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   waited until he received divine direction to depart from Mecca. In anticipation of receiving this direction, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   began making preparations and informed Abu Bakr. On the night of his departure, Muhammad's house was besieged by men of the Quraysh, who had seen large numbers of the Muslims leave the city and had planned to kill him as soon as he left. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , who was renowned for his trustworthiness, owned various properties of members the Quraysh entrusted to him and he asked Ali to stay behind to return them and to fulfill his obligations on his behalf. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   asked Ali to wear his cloak and to lie down on his bed assuring him of God's protection. Ali had worn Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   cloak, leading the assassins to think prophet Muhammad ﷺ   had not yet departed. Ali risked his life by staying in Mecca but ultimately survived the plot. He would later leave for Medina with his mother, Fatima bint Asad, Prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   daughters Fatimah and Umm Kulthum, as well as two other women, Muhammad's wife Sawda and wetnurse Umm Ayman.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and Abu Bakr left the city and took shelter in a cave atop the Thawr mountain south of Mecca before continuing their journey to elude the Quraysh party pursuing them led by Suraqa bin Malik. They stayed in the cave for three days before resuming their journey. During the journey, whenever Suraqa neared Muhammad and Abu Bakr, Suraqa's horse stumbled until he finally gave up on the desire of capturing the prophet ﷺ  . Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and Abu Bakr turned to the Red Sea, following the coastline up to Medina, arriving at Quba'. He stopped at Quba' and established a mosque there. He waited there for fourteen days for Ali and his family to join him. Thereafter he continued to Medina, participated in their first Friday prayer on the way. Upon reaching the city, they were greeted cordially by its people.

Because of assassination attempts from the Quraysh, and prospect of success in Yathrib, a city 320 km (200 mi) north of Mecca, Muhammad emigrated there in 622 CE. According to Muslim tradition, after receiving divine direction to depart Mecca, Muhammad began taking preparation and informed Abu Bakr of his plan. On the night of his departure, Muhammad's house was besieged by men of the Quraysh who planned to kill him in the morning. At the time, Muhammad possessed various properties of the Quraysh given to him in trust; so he handed them over to 'Ali and directed him to return them to their owners. It is said that when Muhammad emerged from his house, he recited the ninth verse of surah Ya Sin of the Quran and threw a handful of dust at the direction of the besiegers, rendering the besiegers unable to see him. After eight days' journey, Muhammad entered the outskirts of Medina on 28 June 622, but did not enter the city directly. He stopped at a place called Quba', a place some miles from the main city, and established a mosque there. On 2 July 622, he entered the city. Yathrib was soon renamed Madinat an-Nabi (Arabic: مَدينة النّبي, literally "City of the Prophet"), but an-Nabi was soon dropped, so its name is "Medina", meaning "the city".

The following hadith sums up many of the events of the Prophet’s emigration: It was narrated on the authority of A’ishah that he Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said to the Muslims: 
> “In a dream I have been shown your place of immigration, a land of date palm trees, between two lava fields, the two stony tracts.” So, some people immigrated to Madinah, and most of those people who had previously immigrated to the land of Ethiopia returned to Madinah. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Madinah, but the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said to him, “Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to emigrate also.” Abu Bakr said, “Do you indeed expect this? May my father be sacrificed for you!” The Prophet said, “Yes.” So Abu Bakr stayed behind for the sake of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessingsbe be upon him) so that he could accompany him. He fed two she-camels he owned for four months. 
>
> One day, while we [A’ishah is still narrating] were sitting in Abu Bakr’s house at noon, someone said to Abu Bakr, “This is the Prophet ﷺ   with his head covered, coming at a time at which he never used to visit us before.” Abu Bakr said, “May my father and mother be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for something important.” So the Prophet ﷺ   came and asked permission to enter, and he was admitted. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr: “Tell everyone who is present with you to go away.” Abu Bakr replied, “There is no one here but you are my family. 
> 
> May my father be sacrificed for you, O Messenger of Allah!” The Prophet said, “I have been given permission to emigrate.” Abu Bakr said, “Shall I accompany you?” The Messenger of Allah ﷺ   said, “Yes.” Abu Bakr said, “O Messenger of Allah, may my father be sacrificed for you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.” The Messenger of Allah ﷺ   replied, “(I will accept it) with payment.” So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma’, the daughter of Abu Bakr, cut a piece from her waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was named dhat al-nitaqayn, the One with Two Waistbelts. 
>
> Then the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the mountain of Thawr and stayed there for three nights. Abdullah ibn Abi Bakr, who was an intelligent and wise youth, stayed (with them) overnight. He would leave them before daybreak so that in the morning he would be with the Quraysh, as if he had spent the night in Makkah. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became dark he would (go and) inform them of it. Amir ibn Fuhayrah, the freed slave of Abu Bakr, used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after nightfall. So they always had fresh milk at night, the milk of their sheep. Amir ibn Fuhayrah would then take the flock away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did the same on each of those three nights. 
>
> The Messenger of Allah ﷺ   and Abu Bakr had hired a man from the tribe of Banu Ad-Dayl from the family of BanuAbd ibn Adiy as an expert guide, … he was of the religion of the polytheists of the Quraysh, but the Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two she-camels and made an appointment with him to bring their two she-camels to the cave of the mountain of Thawr in the morning after three nights had passed. And (when they set out),Amir ibn Fuhayrah and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the coast. 
>
> Ibn Shihab said: Abdur-Rahman ibn Malik Al-Mudliji, who was the nephew of Suraqah ibn Malik, told me that his father informed him that he heard Suraqah saying: The messengers of the Quraysh came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons who would kill or arrest the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their blood-money. While I was sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe, a man from them came to us and stood while we were sitting, and said, “O Suraqah! I have just seen some people far away on the shore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companion.” Suraqah added: I realized that it must have been them. But I said, “No, it is not them, but you must have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw setting out.” I stayed in the gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. I ordered my slave-girl to get my horse, which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. 
> 
> Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e., Muhammad and Abu Bakr), my horse stumbled and I fell down from it. Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of the Qur’an by the Messenger of Allah ﷺ   who was not looking around although Abu Bakr kept doing that, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but it could hardly lift its forelegs from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its forelegs caused dust to rise up in the sky like smoke. 
> 
> Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which I disliked came out. So I called to them to let them know they were safe. They stopped, and I remounted my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came to my mind that the cause of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) would become victorious. So I said to him, “Your people have assigned a reward equal to the blood-money for your capture.” Then I told them all the plans the people of Makkah had made concerning them. Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did not ask for anything, but the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Do not tell others about us.” Then I requested him to write for me a guarantee of security. He ordered Amir bin Fuhayrah to write it for me on a piece of animal skin, then the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) went on his way. 
>
> When the Muslims of Madinah heard that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) had departed Makkah and was heading towards them, they started going to the harrah (stony tract formed of lava) every morning. They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went into their houses, a Jew climbed up onto the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for something, and he saw the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) and his companions dressed in white clothes, as if they were emerging out of a desert mirage. The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice, “O Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!”

At the time of the rule of the second righteous khalif Umar ibn Al Khattab, the year of Hijrah was established as the beginning of the Muslim era and as the first year of the Islamic calendar. 

With regard to the first Companions of the Prophet ﷺ   to emigrate, Al-Bara’ (may Allah be pleased with him) said: 
> "The first ones who came to us of the Companions of the Prophet ﷺ   were Musab ibnUmayr and Ibn Umm Maktum. They started to teach us the Qur’an. Then Ammar, Bilal, and Sad came, then Umar ibn Al-Khattab came with twenty others. Then the Prophet ﷺ   came, and I never saw the people of Madinah rejoice more than that. They rejoiced so much that I saw the girls and boys saying, ‘This is the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him), he has come’"

### Medina Period 🕌

<details><summary>

## Construction of first mosques

</summary>
The oldest mosque ever built was the Masjid al-Quba. Quba used to be a village not far from Medina. It was built right after hijra, which is the emigration of the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and his followers to the city of Medina in 622 CE. The Prophet and his companions helped to build it.

Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, known in English as The Prophet's Mosque, is a mosque built by the Islamic prophet Muhammad ﷺ   in the city of Medina in the Al Madinah Province of Saudi Arabia. It was the second mosque built by Muhammad in Medina, after Masjid Quba', and is the second largest mosque and second holiest site in Islam, both titles ranking after the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca.

The mosque was built by prophet Muhammad ﷺ   in 622 CE (1 AH) after his arrival in Medina. Riding a camel called Qaswa, he arrived at the place where this mosque was built, which was being used as a burial ground. Refusing to accept the land as a gift from the two orphans, Sahl and Suhayl, who owned the land, he bought the land which was paid for by Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and it took seven months to complete the construction of the mosque. It measured 30.5 m × 35.62 m. The roof which was supported by palm trunks was made of beaten clay and palm leaves. It was at a height of 3.60 m. The three doors of the mosque were the "Gate of Mercy" (باب الرحمة Bab ar-Rahmah) to the south, "Gate of Gabriel" (باب جبريل Bab Jibril) to the west and "Gate of Women" (باب النساء Bab Nisa) to the east. At this time point in the history of the Mosque, the qiblah wall was facing north to Jerusalem, and al-Suffah was along the northern wall.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   himself helped in the construction. He started carrying unburned bricks for its building and while doing so, he would say, “This load is better than the load of Khaybar, for it is more pious in the sight of Allah and purer and better rewardable.” He was also saying, 
> "O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Muhajirun (Immigrants)."

## Establishment of Athan (Call to Prayer)

</summary>

As there was no definite arrangement for calling people to prayer, Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed to call people in a loud voice at each prayer time, a system later replaced by Adhan believed to be informed to Abdullah ibn Zayd and Umar in their dreams, and liked and introduced by Muhammadﷺ  .

One night a man of Khazraj, 'Abd Allah ibn Zayd, who had been at the Second 'Aqabah, had a dream which the next day he recounted to the Prophet: "There passed by me a man wearing two green garments and he carried in his hand a ndqiis, so I said unto him: "0 slave of God, wilt thou sell me that naqusi" "What wilt thou do with it?" he said. "We will summon the people to prayer with it," I answered. "Shall I not show thee a better way?" he said. "What way is that?" I asked, and he answered: "That thou shouldst say: `God is most Great, Alldhu Akbar`." The man in green repeated this magnification four times, then each of the following twice: `I testify that there is no god but God; I testify that Muhammad is the messenger of God; come unto the prayer; come unto salvation; God is most Great`; and then once again `there is no god but God`.

The Prophet said that this was a true vision, and he told him to go to
Bilal, who had an excellent voice, and teach him the words exactly as he
had heard them in his sleep. The highest house in the neighbourhood of the
Mosque belonged to a woman of the clan of Najjar, and Bilal would come
there before every dawn and would sit on the roof waiting for the
daybreak. When he saw the first faint light in the east he would stretch out
his arms and say in supplication: "0 God I praise Thee, and I ask Thy Help
for Quraysh, that they may accept Thy religion." Then he would stand and
utter the call to prayer. 

Bilal was tortured by Meccans, he was dragged in chains along the streets of Mecca and kept saying "Ahadun Ahad" (Allah the One) because he did not know anything else about Islam. And now he was the first person to say athan and the first muathin in the an-Nabawi mosque.

## Yathrib Becomes Medina

</summary>

The name “Yathrib” soon became obsolete. People began to call it “Medina-tun-Nabi,” – the City of the Prophet. In due course, usage caused a contraction of this name to be adopted simply as “Medina” – “the City,” and that's what the name of the city of the Prophet of Islam has remained ever since. 

### Constitution of Medina

After the arrival of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   in Medina, its people could be divided into four groups:

- The Muslims: emigrants from Mecca and Ansars of Medina.
- The hypocrites; they nominally embraced Islam, but actually were against it.
- Those from Aws and Khazraj who were still pagans, but were inclined to embrace Islam.
- The Jews; they were huge in number and formed an important community there.

In order to establish peaceful coexistence among this heterogeneous population, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   invited the leading personalities of all the communities to reach a formal agreement which would provide a harmony among the communities and security to the city of Medina, and finally drew up the Constitution of Medina, also known as the Medina Charter, which formed "a kind of alliance or federation" among the prevailing communities. It specified the mutual rights and obligations of the Muslims and Jews of Medina, and prohibited any alliance with the outside enemies. It also declared that any dispute would be referred to Muhammad for settlement.

The basic population of Medina consisted of its three Jewish tribes, the Quainuqa, the Quraiza and the Nadhir; and of the two Arab tribes, the Aus and the Khazraj. (Arabs, Islam and the Arab Caliphate in the Early Middle Ages. 1969)

The Jews were farmers, merchants, traders, money-lenders, landlords and industrialists. They had grown rich through the practice of usury and they enjoyed a monopoly of the armaments industry in Arabia.

The two Arab tribes of Medina, Aus and Khazraj, made their living by farming. Before the arrival of the Prophet, they had been locked up in a war against each other which had lasted for more than five generations. They had fought their last battle only four years earlier, i.e., in A.D. 618, and it had left them utterly exhausted and prostrate.

There were a few Christians also living in Medina. They did not cotton to the Prophet of Islam because he repudiated the doctrine of Trinity, and preached the Unity of the Creator.

A fourth group in Medina was to spring up a little later, made up of the “hypocrites” or the “disaffected.” During the Prophet's mission in Makkah, there were many Muslims who had to hide their true faith for fear of persecution. In Medina, the situation was reversed. These people (the hypocrites) were nominal Muslims; they outwardly professed Islam but they were not sincere. They were a potential source of subversion, sabotage and insurrection.

#### The Charter or Constitution of Medina
The citizens of Yathrib acknowledged Muhammad ﷺ   as their sovereign, and he gave them a “Citizen's Charter” which is believed to have been the first written document in Islam (other than Qur’an). The original charter as preserved by Ibn Ishaq, contains forty-seven (47) clauses. Following are the more important ones out of them:
* All disputes between any two parties in Yathrib would be referred to Muhammad ﷺ   for his decision on them.
* Muslims and Jews would enjoy the same rights.
* Each group in Yathrib would follow its own faith, and no one group would meddle in the affairs of any other groups.
* In the event of an external attack upon Yathrib, both groups, i.e., the Muslims and the Jews, would defend the city.
* Both groups would refrain from shedding blood in the city.
* Muslims would not go to war against other Muslims for the sake of non-Muslims.

### Muhajireen and Ansar
Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   changed the names of the two Muslim groups now living in Medina. He called the refugees from Makkah `Muhajireen` (Emigrants); and he called the citizens of Yathrib who had welcomed them, `Ansar` (Supporters). The two groups were known by these names ever after.

Though we hear the names of one or two wealthy Yathribites, the bulk of them appear to have been poor. In Yathrib in the Prophet's time, there was only one wedding garment; ornaments had to be borrowed from the Jews. This poverty was probably aggravated by the Jewish money-lending. (Mohammed and the Rise of Islam, London, 1931)

But if the Ansar were poor, the Muhajireen were even poorer. In fleeing from Makkah, they had abandoned everything they had possessed, and when they came to Yathrib seeking sanctuary, they were penniless. In a short time, their situation became desperate. They had to do something to make a living. But since they knew nothing about agriculture, the best they could do was to work as unskilled laborers in the fields and gardens of the Jews and the Ansar.

One of the gambits in the efforts of the Apostle to rehabilitate the homeless Muhajireen in Medina, and to integrate them into the economic and social life of the city, was to make them “brothers” of the Ansar. A few months after his arrival in Medina, he told the Muhajireen and the Ansar that they had to live as “brothers” of each other, and paired them off as follows:
* Ammar ibn Yasir -- Hudhayfa al-Yamani
* Abu Bakr Siddique -- Kharja bin Zayd
* Umar bin al-Khattab -- Utban bin Malik
* Uthman bin Affan -- Aus bin Thabit
* Mas'ab ibn Umayr -- Abu Ayyub
* Abu Obaidah Aamer al-Jarrah -- Saad ibn Maadh
* Zubayr ibn al-Awwam -- Salama bin Waqsh
* Abdur Rahman bin Auf -- Saad ibn Rabi
* Talha bin Obaidullah -- Ka'ab ibn Malik

Ali ibn Abi Talib alone was left without a “brother.” 

Muhammad ibn Ishaq: 
The Apostle himself took Ali by hand and said: “This is my brother.” So God's Apostle, the Lord of the sent ones, and leader of the God-fearing, Apostle of the Lord of the worlds, the peerless and unequaled, and Ali ibn Abi Talib became brothers. (The Life of the Messenger of God)

The Muhajireen had lost all their material possessions in Makkah, and all of them entered Yathrib (Medina) empty-handed. They consisted of two distinct groups. One group was made up of those men who were merchants and traders by profession, and they were very rich. When they went to Medina, they entered business, were successful at it, and they became rich again.

The other group comprised the “ascetics” of Islam. They were poor in Makkah, and when they migrated to Medina, they still chose to be poor. They spurned worldly riches, and they never held economic power in their hands at any time. Representatives of this group were men like Abu Dharr el-Ghiffari; Ammar ibn Yasir and Miqdad ibn al-Aswad.

The Ansar treated the Muhajireen from Makkah better than the real brothers of the latter would have done. They lodged them in their own homes, gave them household effects; made them partners in farming, or gave them half of their land. Those Ansars who were in business, made the Muhajirs their partners in business.

The Ansar were indispensable for the physical survival of Islam. Where would Islam be and where would the Muhajireen be if the Ansar had not given them sanctuary? When hostilities with the idolaters began, it were the Ansar, and not the Muhajireen, who bore the brunt of fighting. They were also the recipients of Heaven's compliments and recognition, as we read in the following verse of Quran:
    
    But those who, before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the faith, – show their affection to such as came to them for refuge, and entertain no desire, in their hearts for things given to the (latter), but give them preference over themselves, even though poverty was their (own lot). And those saved from the covetousness of their own souls, – they are the ones that achieve prosperity.
    Chapter 59; verse 9

### Revelation of Surah Al-Baqara

Islam continued to spread rapidly throughout the clans of Aws and Khazraj, and some believers looked forward to the day when, thanks to the covenant with the Jews, the oasis would be one harmonious whole. But the Revelation now gave warning of hidden elements of discord. It was about this time that the longest surah of the Koran began to be revealed, al-Baqarah (the Heifer), which is placed at the beginning of the Book, immediately after the sevenverses of al-Patihah, the Opening. It starts with a definiton of the rightly guided: 

    Alif - Lam - Mim. This beyond doubt is the Book, a guidance unto the God-fearing, who believe in the Unseen and perform the prayer and give ofthat which We have bestowed upon them; and who believe in that which is revealed unto thee and in that which was revealed before thee, and who are certain ofthe Hereafter. These are they who follow guidance from their Lord and these are they who shall prosper.

### Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   marries Aisha

In the first year of Hijrah, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   married Aisha, a daughter of his closest friend Abu Bakr.

### Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   make dua for Medina

Abu Bakr, Amir and Bilal cought a severe fever and lied in their courtyard almost too weak to speak. And Bilal chanted a poetry mentioning how they miss Mecca.

In that occasion, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   prayed: "0 God, make Medina as dear unto us as thou hast made Mecca, or even dearer. And bless for us its waters and its grain, and carry away from it its fever as far as Mahya'ah.?" And God answered his prayer.

## 624 Change of Qibla to Kaaba

</summary>

During the first sixteen months after the Hijra (Migration), the Qibla of the Muslims for prayers was Jerusalem (they faced Jerusalem when saying their prayers). Before receiving the first revelation and becoming a Muslim, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was calling himself a follower of the religion of Ibrahim. Dr. Montgomery Watt and John Christopher say that in the beginning, the Prophet had hoped that facing Jerusalem when praying, would cause the hearts of the Jews of Yathrib to incline toward him, and they would acknowledge him as a Messenger of God. Then the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   received Wahi (Revelation) commanding him to change the orientation point from Jerusalem in the north to Makkah in the south.

    "Many a time We have seen you turn your face owards heaven. We will make you turn towards a 'qiblah' that will please you." (Surah al-Baqarah, 2:144). 

God commanded prophet Muhammad ﷺ   to change the Qibla. The command to change the Qibla was given in verse 144 of the second chapter of Al-Qur’an al-Majid.

## Fasting in Ramadan becomes obligatory

</summary>

In Sha'aban (8th month) of the second year of Hijra, fasting during the month of Ramadan (9th month) was made mandatory for the Muslims. They, therefore, fasted during the following month. At the end of the month of fasting, they were required to pay Zakat-al-Fitr, a special poor-tax.

</details><details><summary>
  
## Zakat becomes obligatory

</summary>

In the same year, another tax, Zakat-ul-Mal, was imposed upon the Muslims. This tax is assessed at the rate of 2.5 per cent of a Muslim's wealth. In the times of the Prophet, this tax was paid into the Bayt-ul-Mal or public treasury, and was spent on the welfare of the poor and the sick members of the community. But if there is no Bayt-ul-Mal, the Muslims must pay it to the deserving poor, the widows, the orphans and those members of the community who have no means of supporting themselves.

## 624: ⚔️ Battle of Badr

</summary>

### Causes of and preparation for fighting
Following the emigration, the Meccans seized the properties of the Muslim emigrants in Mecca. The Quraysh leaders of Mecca persecuted the newly converted Muslims there, and they migrated to Medina to avoid persecution, abandoning their properties. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and the Muslims found themselves in a more precarious situation in Medina than in Mecca. Besides the ultimatum of the Quraysh they had to confront the designs of the hypocrites, and had to be wary of the pagans and Jews also. The trading caravans of Quraysh, whose usual route was from Mecca to Syria, used to set the neighboring tribes of Medina against the Muslims, which posed a great danger to the security of Muslims of Medina given that war was common at that time. In view of all this, the Quran granted permission to the persecuted Muslims to defend themselves: 

    "Permission to fight is granted to those against whom war is made, because they have been wronged, and God indeed has the power to help them. They are those who have been driven out of their homes unjustly only because they affirmed: "Our Lord is God"" 
    Quran 22:39-40

The Quran further justifies taking defensive measures by stating the following: 

    "And if God had not repelled some men by others, the earth would have been corrupted. But God is a Lord of Kindness to (His) creatures" 
    Quran 2:251

According to Quranic description, war is an abnormal and unenviable way which, when inevitable, should be limited to minimal casualty, and free from any kind of transgression on the part of the believers. In this regard, the Quran says, `"Fight in the cause of God with those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors"` (2:190), and `"And fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression"` (2:193).

Thus, to ensure the security of the Ansars and Muhajirun of Medina, Muhammad resorted to the following measures:
* Visiting the neighboring tribes to enter into non-aggression treaty with them to secure Medina from their attacks.
* Blocking or intercepting the trading caravans of the Quraysh to compel them into a compromise with the Muslims. As these trading enterprises were the main strength of the Quraysh, Muhammad employed this strategy to reduce their strength.

Sending small scouting parties to gather intelligence about Quraysh movement, and also to facilitate the evacuation of those Muslims who were still suffering in Mecca and could not migrate to Medina because of their poverty or any other reason. It is in this connection that the following verse of the Quran was revealed: 

    And why should you not fight in the cause of God and for those who, being weak, are ill-treated (and oppressed)? Men, women, and children, whose cry is: "Our Lord! Rescue us from this town, whose people are oppressors; and raise for us from Thee one who will protect; and raise for us from Thee one who will help!" 
    Quran 4:75

A key battle in the early days of Islam, the Battle of Badr was the first large-scale battle between the nascent Islamic community of Medina and their opponent Quraysh of Mecca where the Muslims won a decisive victory. The battle has some background. In 2 AH (623 CE) in the month of Rajab, a Muslim patrolling group attacked a Quraysh trading caravan killing its elite leader Amr ibn Hazrami. The incident happening in a sacred month displeased Muhammad, and enraged the Quraysh to a greater extent. The Quran however neutralizes the effect saying that bloodshed in sacred month is obviously prohibited, but Quraysh paganism, persecuting on the Meccan converts, and preventing people from the Sacred Mosque are greater sins (Quran 2:217). Traditional sources say that upon receiving intelligence of a richly laden trading caravan of the Quraysh returning from Syria to Mecca, Muhammadﷺ   took it as a good opportunity to strike a heavy blow on Meccan power by taking down the caravan in which almost all the Meccan people had invested. With full liberty to join or stay back, Muhammad amassed some 313 inadequately prepared men furnished with only two horses and seventy camels, and headed for a place called Badr. Meanwhile, Abu Sufyan, the leader of the caravan, got the information of Muslim march, changed his route towards south-west along Red Sea, and send out a messenger, named Damdam ibn Umar, to Mecca asking for immediate help. The messenger exaggerated the news in a frenzy style of old Arab custom, and misinterpreted the call for protecting the caravan as a call for war.

> 313 Muslims were against the heavily equipped army of 1000 from Quraish.

The Quraysh with all its leading personalities except Abu Lahab marched with a heavily equipped army of more than one thousand men with ostentatious opulence of food supply and war materials. Abu Sufyan's second message that the trading caravan successfully had escaped the Muslim interception, when reached the Quraish force, did not stop them from entering into a major offensive with the Muslim force, mainly because of the belligerent Quraysh leader Abu Jahl. The news of a strong Quraysh army and its intention reaching the Islamic prophet Muhammad, he held a council of war where the followers advised him to go forward. 

The Prophet felt bound to consult his men and to let theirs be the choice between advancing and retreating. Abu Bakr and 'Umar spoke for the Emigrants in favour of advancing and then, by way of confirmation of all that they had said, an ally of the Bani Zuhrah who had only recently come to Medina, Miqdad by name, rose to his feet and added: "0 Messenger of God, do what God hath shown thee to do. We will not say unto thee as the children of Israel said unto Moses: Go thou and thy Lord and fight; we shall sit here, but we will say: 'Go thou and thy Lord and fight, and with you we also will fight, on the right and on the left, before thee and behind thee.'" AbdAllah ibn Mas'ud used to tell in after years of the great light that dawned on the Prophet's face when he heard those words and as he blessed their speaker.

> A light slumber came upon him, and when he woke he said: "Be of good
cheer, Abu Bakr; the help of God hath come to thee. Here is Gabriel and in
his hand is the rein of a horse which he is leading, and he is armed for
war."

The Prophet took up a handful of pebbles and shouting at Quraysh "Defaced be those faces!", he hurled the pebbles at them, conscious that he was hurling disaster. Then he gave the order to charge. 

    Thou threwest not when thou tbreu/est, but it was God that threw.

These words were part of the Revelation which came immediately after the
battle.

When the believers were ordered to charge, they did not charge alone, as
well the Prophet knew, for he had been promised: 

    I will help you with a thousand of the angels, troop on troop? 

And the Angels also had received a Divine message: 

    When thy Lord revealed unto the angels: Lo, I am with you, so make firm the believers. I shall cast terror into the hearts of the disbelievers. It is for you to strike off their heads, and to smite their every finger.

The battle occurred on 13 March 624 CE (17 Ramadan, 2 AH) and resulted in a heavy loss on the Quraysh side: around seventy men, including chief leaders, were killed and a similar number were taken prisoner. Islamic tradition attributes the Muslim victory to the direct intervention of God: he sent down angels that emboldened the Muslims and wreaked damage on the enemy force.

By noon the battle was over. The Quraysh fled. Forty-nine of the enemy had fallen. An equal number was captured. The believers had lost fourteen men on the field of battle. (Mohammed, the Man and his Faith, Tor Andre, 1960)

Badr is the most important battle in the entire history of Islam, and one of the most important in world history. Victory guaranteed the existence of Islam, and the physical survival of the Muslim community of Medina which heretofore had appeared, at best, to be precarious.

But the importance of Mohammed's success (in the battle of Badr) cannot be measured by the material damage which he inflicted (upon the pagans of Mecca). Considering the momentous issues involved, we must allow that Badr, like Marathon, is one of the greatest and most memorable battles in all history. (A Literary History of the Arabs, A. Nicholson, 1969)

Most of Quraysh escaped, but some fifty were mortally wounded or killed outright in the battle or overtaken and cut down as they fled. About the same number were taken captive. Umar suggested that they should not keep the captives alive, but Abu Bakr was in favour of letting the captives live, in
the hope that sooner or later they might become believers, and the Prophet
inclined to his view. But later in the day, when 'Umar returned to the shelter, he found the Prophet and Abu Bakr in tears on account of a Revelation which had come: 

    It is not for a prophet to hold captives until he hath made great slaughter in the land. Ye would have for yourselves the gains of this world and God would have for you the Hereafter, and God is Mighty, Wise.

But the Revelation then made it clear that the decision to spare the captives had been accepted by God and should not now be revoked; and the Prophet was given a message for the captives themselves: 

    O Prophet, say unto those captives who are in your hands: If God knoweth any good in your hearts, He will give you better than that which hath been taken from you, and He will forgive you. Verily God is Forgiving, Merciful.

There was, however, one man, Abu Jahl, who clearly could not be allowed to live. The general opinion was that he had been killed and the Prophet gave orders that his body should be searched for. 'Abdallah ibn Mas'ud went out again to the battlefield and searched until he found the man who had done more than any other to stir up hatred of Islam amongst the people of Mecca. Abu Jahl still had enough life in him to recognise the enemy who now stood over him. 'Abdallah had been the first man to recite the Koran aloud in front of the Ka'bah, and Abu jahl had struck him a severe blow and wounded him in the face, for he was merely a confederate of Zuhrah and a poor one at that, his mother having been a slave. 'Abdallah now placed his foot on the neck of Abu jahl, who said: "Thou hast climbed high indeed, little shepherd." Then he asked him which way the fortunes of war had swung that day, his implication being that next time they would swing in the opposite direction. `"God and His
messenger have won,"` he answered. Then he killed Abu Jahl. 

Badr was a Muslim triumph, as total as it was unexpected; the Muslims lost 14 men and the Quraysh from 50 to 70, including their leader, Abu Jahl. It was an immense psychological victory and there was plentiful booty for the economically distressed Emigrants. This was no mere raid, however. It pitted Muslim against non-Muslim in Holy War, and fathers against sons in civil strife. The Quraysh casualties were extraordinarily high, and since most of them had occurred among the chiefs, the leadership at Mecca was permanently crippled. (Allah's Commonwealth, 1973)

### Dhul-Fiqar Sword

Among the spoils of the battle of Badr was a famous sword of admirable temper called Dhul-Fiqar, or the Piercer. Mohammed ever afterwards bore it when in battle, and his son-in-law, Ali, inherited it at his death. (The Life of Mohammed, Washington Irving)

Abdullah Yusuf Ali, the translator and commentator of Qur’an, says that the battle of Badr is called the Furqaan in Muslim theology, because it was the first trial of strength by battle, in Islam, between the powers of good and evil. Furqaan means criterion between right and wrong; decision between the forces of Faith and Unbelief. The battle of Badr is called by this name.

### Men of the Pit

The Prophet gave orders that the bodies of all the infidels slain in the
battle should be thrown into a pit. Prophet Muhammad spoke to the men of the pit.

> "O men of the pit," he said, "kinsmen of your Prophet, ill was the kinship ye showed him. Liar ye called me, when others took me in; against me ye fought, when others helped me to victory. Have ye found it to be true, what your Lord promised you? I have found it to be true, what my Lord promised me."
> Martin Lings "Muhammad: His Life Based on the Earliest Sources"

### The Prisoners of War
The Muslims captured fifty prisoners of war. They were brought before the Prophet who had to decide what to do with them. He consulted his companions in the matter. Umar advised him to kill them all, but Abu Bakr advised him to set them free for ransom. The Prophet accepted Abu Bakr's advice.

Since there was no house of detention in Medina, the Prophet distributed the prisoners among the Muslim families. These families treated their prisoners as if they were their guests. Some of them fed their own food to their “guests” and themselves went hungry. They actually embarrassed their prisoners by their solicitude for their welfare. The rich prisoners were released for a ransom. Those prisoners who could not pay a ransom but could read and write, were asked to teach these arts to the Muslim children, and when they did, they were also released. Those prisoners who were destitute, were released without any ransom.

## Marriage of Ali and Fatima

</summary>

God gave victory to Islam in the battle of Badr in the year 2 of Hijri. Two months after the battle, Fatima Zahra, the daughter of Muhammad Mustafa, and Ali, the son of Abu Talib were married.

Fatima (c. 605/15-632) and Ali (c. 600-661) were both significant figures in early Islam: Fatima has been compared to Mary, the mother of Jesus, especially in Shia Islam. Muhammad is said to have regarded her as the best of woman and the dearest person to him. Ali was the fourth of the Rashidun Caliphs.

 There is evidence in Sunni and Shia sources that some of the companions, including Abu Bakr and Umar, had earlier asked for Fatima's hand in marriage but were turned down by Muhammad, who said he was waiting for the moment fixed by destiny. It is also said that Ali was reticent to ask Muhammad to marry Fatima on the account of his poverty. When Muhammad put forward Ali's proposal to Fatima, she remained silent, which was understood as a tacit agreement. On the basis of this report, woman's consent in marriage has always been necessary in Islamic law. Muhammad also suggested that Ali sell his shield to pay the bridal gift (mahr).

Muhammad performed the wedding ceremony, and they prepared an austere wedding feast with donations from Madinans. Later the couple moved into a house next to Muhammad's quarters in Medina. Their marriage lasted about ten years until Fatima's death.

It was narrated that 'Aishah and Umm Salamah said:
> “The Messenger of Allah commanded us to prepare Fatimah (for her wedding) and take her in to 'Ali. We went to the house and sprinkled it with soft earth from the land of Batha'. Then we stuffed two pillows with (date - palm) fiber which we picked with our own hands. Then we offered dates and raisins to eat, and sweet water to drink. We went and got some wood and set it up at the side of the room, to hang the clothes and water skins on. And we never saw any wedding better than the wedding of Fatimah.”

As with the majority of Muslims, the couple lived in severe poverty in the early years of Islam. In particular, both had to do hard physical work to get by. It has also been related that Muhammad taught the couple a tasbih to help ease the burden of their poverty: Tasbih of Fatima consists of the phrases `Allah-hu Akbar` (lit. 'God is the greatest'), `Al-hamdu-lillah` (lit. 'all praise is due to God'), and `Subhan-Allah` (lit. 'God is glorious'). Their financial circumstances later improved after more lands fell to Muslims in the Battle of Khaybar.

Fatima and Ali were survived by four children: Hasan, Husayn, Zaynab and Umm Kulthum. In particular, Muhammad was very fond of his grandsons. Widely reported is his statement that Hasan and Husayn would be the lords of the youth of the paradise.

## Battle of Porridge

</summary>

> The Campaign of As-Sawiq was called after the type of **porridge** that Abu Sufyan and his companions threw from their camels to lighten their loads in order to flee from any encounter with the Prophet (peace be upon him).

When Safwan ibn Omaiyah, the Jews, and the hypocrites were conducting their hostile intrigues and plots, Abu Sufyan was planning to carry out some military hostilities in oder to reply quickly to their loses at Badr. These aimed at saving the face of his people and impressing on the Arabs that Quraish was still a strong military power, after their defeat at Badr, and after the Arabs started to think little about them. Abu Sufyan had taken an oath that he would not approach any of his wives until he had taken revenge from Muhammed. He was not brave enough to attack Medinah in broad daylight, so he infiltrated the outskirts of Medinah at night.

Abu Sufyan led 200 riders and entered the outskirts of a place called Al-Uraid, staying over night with Banu An-Nadeer in the Jewish district of Khaybar. He knocked on the door of Huyai ibn Akhtab, one of the Jewish leaders and the father of Safiyah, a Mother of the Believers. However, Huyai was too scared to open the door for him. Therefore, Abu Sufyan left and went to Salam ibn Mashkam, the chief of Banu An-Nadeer and their treasurer. He used to keep their money and jewellery, which he then lent to the peple of Mecca. Salam entertained Abu Sufyan, offered him food and wine, and gave him a full account of the news of the Muslims.

In the morning, Abu Sufyan dispatched men from Quraish, who went to a suburb of Medina and burnt the palm trees there. They also found in the area two Muslims from the Ansar, Mabid ibn Amr and his companion, so they killed them and then left to return to their base. The incident became known to the people in the city, and as a result, The Prophet (peace be upon him) left with 200 Muhajareen (Immigrants) and Ansar to catch the men from Quraish, leaving Basheer ibn Abdul-Munthir to run the affairs In Medina.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions reached the area of Qirqirah Al-Kudr, but Abu Sufyan and the disbelievers managed to escape after they had thrown aside many of their goods and much barley porridge called As-Sawiq that the Arabs used to prepare. This was in order to lighten their loads and escape any confrontation with the Muslims. The Prophet (peace be upon him) had left Abu Lubabah ibn Amir in Medina to run the affairs there in the Prophet’s absence. Abu Lubabah is the same Companion that was left to dispose of matters in Medina during the battles of Badr and Banu Qainuqa. The Prophet (peace be upon him) returned to Medina 5 days later.

## 625: ⚔️ Battle of Uhud

</summary>

The Battle of Uhud (غَزْوَة أُحُد,) was fought on Saturday, 23 March 625 AD (7 Shawwal, 3 AH), in the valley north of Mount Uhud. The Qurayshi Meccans, led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, commanded an army of 3,000 men toward Muhammad's stronghold in Medina. The battle was the only battle throughout the Muslim–Quraysh War in which the Muslims did not manage to defeat their enemy and it came just a year after the Battle of Badr.

Abu Sufyan became the de facto leader of the Quraish after the death of Amr ibn Hishām at Badr nine months prior. Wanting to avenge the Meccan's losses at the Battle of Badr, he marched upon Medina from Makkah on 10 December 624 AD with a force three times stronger than that of the Meccans at Badr. Another reason for the battle was to protect the trade route of Abu Sufyan's caravans. The Battle of Uhud was the second military encounter between the Meccans and the Muslims and the first one in which the Muslims were on the defensive side. The Muslims readied for war soon afterward and the two armies fought in the valley below the northern face of Mount Uhud.

### Meccan march to Medina

At the head of a 3,000-strong army, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb set forth toward Madinah to avenge the Meccans' defeat at Badr. They encamped on the pastures north of the city, hoping that the Muslims would come out to meet them. According to the early Muslim historian Ibn Ishaq, a number of Meccan women are said to have accompanied Abu Sufyan's army to boost their morale, including Hind bint 'Utbah, Abu Sufyan's wife.

A scout alerted Muhammad of the Meccan army's presence and numbers late on Thursday, 20 December 624. The next morning, a Muslim council-of-war convened, and there was a dispute over how to best repel the Meccans. Muhammad and many of the wise senior figures suggested that it would be safer to fight within Medina and take advantage of its heavily fortified strongholds. Younger Muslims argued that the Meccans were destroying their crops and that huddling in the strongholds would destroy Muslim prestige. Muhammad eventually conceded to the wishes of the latter and readied the Muslim force for battle.

### Muslim encampment at Uhud

A group of approximately 1,000 Muslim men set out northward from Madinah toward Mount Uhud late on Friday, 21 December 624. Early the next morning, they took a position on the lower slopes of the hill of Uhud. Shortly before the battle commenced, 'Abdallah ibn Ubayy, chief of the Khazraj, along with 300 other men, withdrew their support for Muhammad and returned to Medina, with reports suggesting Ibn Ubayy's discontent with the plan to march out from Medina to meet the Meccans. Ibn Ubayy and his followers would later receive censure in the Qur'an for this act.

    What ye suffered on the day the two armies met, was with the leave of Allah, in order that He might test the believers. And in order that He might test the Hypocrites also, these were told: "Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city)." They said: "Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you." They were that day nearer to Disbelief than to Faith, saying with their mouths what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal. (They are) the ones that say, of their brethren slain, while they themselves sit (at ease): "If only they had listened to us they would not have been slain." Say: "Avert death from your own selves, if ye speak the truth."
    Qur'an, Surah 3 (Al Imran), Ayah 166–168

The Muslim force, now numbering around 700 encamped on the slopes of Uhud, facing Madinah, with their back protected by the mountain. Before the battle, Muhammad had assigned 50 archers on a nearby rocky hill at the west side of the Muslim camp. This was a strategic decision in order to shield the vulnerable flanks of the outnumbered Muslim army; the archers on the hill were to protect the left flank, while the right flank was to be protected by the Mount of Uhud situated on the east side of the Muslim camp. Protecting the flanks of the Muslim army meant that the Meccan army would not be able to turn around the Muslim camp, and thus the Muslim army wouldn't be surrounded or encircled by the Meccan cavalry, keeping in mind that the Meccan cavalry outnumbered the Muslim cavalry with 50-to-1. Muhammad ordered the Muslim archers to not leave their positions on the hill unless ordered to do so by him, making it clear by uttering these words to the archers,

    "If you see us prevail and start to take spoils, do not come to assist us. And if you see us get vanquished and birds eat from our heads, do not come to assist us."

### The Duels
The Meccan army positioned itself facing the Muslim lines, with the main body led by Abu Sufyan, and the left and right flanks commanded by Ikrimah ibn Abu Jahl, son of Amr ibn Hishām and Khalid ibn al-Walid, respectively. 'Amr ibn al-'As was commander of the cavalry and his task was to coordinate the attack between the cavalry wings. They attacked with their initial charge led by the Medinan exile Abu ‘Amir. Thwarted by a shower of stones from the Muslims, Abu ‘Amir and his men were forced to retreat to the camps behind the Meccan lines. The Meccan standard-bearer Talhah ibn Abi Talhah al-‘Abdari, advanced and challenged the enemy to a duel. Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin of Muhammad, rushed forth and struck Talhah down in a single blow. Talhah's brother, Uthman, ran forward to pick up the fallen banner — the Meccan women willing him on with songs and the loud beating of timbrels. Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib emerged from the Muslim ranks, bringing him to a similar fate as Talhah. It was their family that was responsible for the Meccan army's standard-bearing, and thus one by one, Talhah's brothers and sons went to retrieve the Meccan banner and fight unsuccessfully until they all eventually perished. Following the duels, general engagement between the two armies commenced. Meccan confidence quickly began to dissolve as the Muslims swept through their ranks.

### Meccan retreat and counter-attack
The Meccan army was pushed back, and repeated attempts by its cavalry to overrun the left Muslim flank were negated by the Muslim archers. Enjoying the best of these early encounters, the Muslims pierced through the Meccan lines, with victory appearing certain. However, it was the detachment of the Muslim archers, disobeying Muhammad's strict orders to remain stationary, that would shift the outcome of the battle, as most of them ran downhill to join in the advance and despoil the Meccan camp, leaving the flank vulnerable.

At this critical juncture, the Meccan cavalry, led by Khalid ibn al-Walid, exploited this move and attacked the remaining minority of Muslim archers who refused to disobey Muhammad's orders and were still positioned on the hill. From there, the Meccans were then able to target and overrun the Muslim flank and rear. Confusion ensued, and numerous Muslims were killed. The most notable of the killed Muslims was Hamza, who had been thrown down in a surprise attack by the javelin of the Ethiopian slave of Jubayr ibn Mut'im, Wahshi ibn Harb. While the Meccan riposte strengthened, rumors circulated that Muhammad too had perished. It emerged, however, that Muhammad had only been wounded—due to missiles of stone which resulted in a gash on his forehead and lip.

After fierce hand-to-hand combat, most of the Muslims managed to withdraw and regroup higher up on the slopes of Uhud. A small faction was cut off and tried to make its way back to Medina, though many of these were killed. The Meccans' chief offensive arm, its cavalry, was unable to ascend the slopes of Uhud in pursuit of the Muslims, and so the fighting ceased. Hind and her companions are said to have mutilated the Muslim corpses, cutting off their ears and noses; making them into anklets. Hind is reported to have cut open the corpse of Hamza, taking out his liver which she then attempted to eat. Abu Sufyan, after some brief verbal exchanges with Muhammad's companion, Ibn Ishaq records this exchange as follows:

> When (the Qurayshi leader) Abu Sufyan wanted to leave, he went to the top of the mountain and shouted loudly, saying, "You have done a fine work. Victory in war goes by turns: today is in exchange for the day of Badr. Show your superiority, Hubal", that is, vindicate your religion. The Messenger told Umar ibn Khattab (Umar) to go up and answer him and say, "Allah is most high and most glorious. We are not equal: our dead are in paradise, yours are in hell." At this answer, Abu Sufyan said to Umar, "Come up here to me." The Messenger told him to go and see what Abu Sufyan was up to. When he came Abu Sufyan said, "I adjure you by God, Umar, have we killed Muhammad?" "By Allah, you have not, he is listening to what you are saying right now", Umar replied. Abu Sufyan said, "I regard you as more truthful and reliable than Ibn Qami'a", referring to the latter's claim that he had killed Muhammad.

Abu Sufyan then decided to return to Mecca without pressing his advantage of re-attacking the wounded muslims of Madinah.

The battle is generally believed by scholars to be a defeat for the Muslims, as they had incurred greater losses than the Meccans. Chase F. Robinson, writing in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, states the notion that "the Muslims suffered a disheartening defeat is clear enough." Other scholars such as William Montgomery Watt disagree, noting that while the Muslims did not win, the Meccans had failed to achieve their strategic aim of destroying Muhammad and his followers; and that the Meccans' untimely withdrawal indicated weakness on their part. The battle is also noted for the emergence of the military leadership and stratagem of Khalid ibn al-Walid, who would later become the most famous of all Arab generals during the Islamic expansion era, in conquering the Sassanid Empire and Byzantine-held Syria.

For the Muslims, the battle held a religious dimension as well as a military one. They had expected another victory like at Badr, which was considered a sign of God's favor upon them. At Uhud, however, they had barely held off the invaders and had lost a great many men. A verse of the Qur'an revealed soon after the battle cited the Muslims' disobedience and desire for loot as the cause for this setback:

    Indeed, Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you ˹initially˺ swept them away by His Will, then your courage weakened and you disputed about the command and disobeyed after Allah had brought victory within your reach. Some of you were after worldly gain while others desired a heavenly reward. He denied you victory over them as a test, yet He has pardoned you. And Allah is Gracious to the believers.
    Qur'an, sura 3 (Al Imran), ayah 152

According to the Qur'an, then, the misfortunes at Uhud — largely the result of the rear guard abandoning their position in order to seek booty — were partly a punishment and partly a test for steadfastness. Firestone observes that such verses provided inspiration and hope to the Muslims, sacralizing future battles that they would experience. He adds that rather than demoralizing the Muslims, the battle seemed to reinforce the solidarity between them.

The two armies would meet again in 627 at the Battle of the Trench, in which the Muslims would, yet again, have to defend Medina from the Meccans and others.

    (3:121) And [remember] when you left your family in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle [of Uhud]. Allah is All-Hearing, All-Knowing.

    (3:122) And recall when two groups from among you were inclined to flag95 although Allah was their protector; it is in Allah that the believers should put their trust.

    (3:123) For sure Allah helped you at Badr when you were utterly weak. Beware, then, of Allah; perhaps you will be thankful.

> Narrated Zaid bin Thabit: When the Prophet set out for (the battle of) uhud, some of those who had gone out with him, returned. The companions of the Prophet were divided into two groups. One group said, "We will fight them (i.e. the enemy)," and the other group said, "We will not fight them." So there came the Divine Revelation:-- '(O Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.' (4.88) On that, the Prophet said, "That is Taiba (i.e. the city of Medina) which clears one from one's sins as the fire expels the impurities of silver."  (Book #59, Hadith #380)

> Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib: The Prophet appointed 'Abdullah bin Jubair as the commander of the infantry men (archers) who were fifty on the day (of the battle) of uhud. He instructed them, "Stick to your place, and don't leave it even if you see birds snatching us, till I send for you; and if you see that we have defeated the infidels and made them flee, even then you should not leave your place till I send for you." Then the infidels were defeated. By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, "The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what are you waiting for now?" 'Abdullah bin Jubair said, "Have you forgotten what Allah's Apostle said to you?" They replied, "By Allah! We will go to the people (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty." But when they went to them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah's Apostle in their rear was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred seventy men from us. On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his companions had caused the 'Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, "Is Muhammad present amongst these people?" The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice, "Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?" He asked again thrice, "Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?" He then returned to his companions and said, "As for these (men), they have been killed." 'Umar could not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), "You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy is still there." Abu Sufyan said, "Our victory today is a counterbalance to yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed" After that he started reciting cheerfully, "O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They said, "O Allah's Apostle What shall we say?" He said, "Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime." (Then) Abu Sufyan said, "We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza." The Prophet said (to his companions), "Why don't you answer him back?" They asked, "O Allah's Apostle! What shall we say?" He said, "Says Allah is our Helper and you have no helper."  (Book #52, Hadith #276)

> Narrated Anas: When it was the day of uhud, the people left the Prophet while Abu Talha was in front of the Prophet shielding him with his leather shield. Abu Talha was a skillful archer who used to shoot violently. He broke two or three arrow bows on that day. If a man carrying a quiver full of arrows passed by, the Prophet would say (to him), put (scatter) its contents for Abu Talha." The Prophet would raise his head to look at the enemy, whereupon Abu Talha would say, "Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you ! Do not raise your head, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. (Let) my neck (be struck) rather than your neck." I saw 'Aisha, the daughter of Abu Bakr, and Um Sulaim rolling up their dresses so that I saw their leg-bangles while they were carrying water skins on their backs and emptying them in the mouths of the (wounded) people. They would return to refill them and again empty them in the mouths of the (wounded) people. The sword fell from Abu Talha's hand twice or thrice (on that day).  (Book #59, Hadith #393)

Uhud is the day of Talha. Talha distinguished himself at the Battle of Uhud by keeping close to prophet Muhammad while most of the Muslim army fled. He protected Muhammad's face from an arrow by taking the shot in his own hand, as a result of which his index and middle fingers were cut. He was also hit twice in the head, and it was said that he suffered a total of 39 or 75 wounds. Toward the end of the battle, Talha fainted from his heavy injuries, Abu Bakar soon reached their location to check prophet Muhammad condition first, who immediately instructing Abu Bakr to check the condition of Talha, who already passed out due to his severe bloodloss. and his hand was left paralysed. For this heroic defence of prophet Muhammad, Talha earned the byname "the living martyr". Talha is said to be the anonymous believer counted as a "martyr" in Quran 33:23. Abu Bakr also called the battle of Uhud "the day of Talha". Talha is among ten who were promised Paradise.

> Narrated Abu Talha: Slumber overtook us during the battle of uhud while we were in the front files. My sword would fall from my hand and I would pick it up, and again it would fall down and I would pick it up again.  (Book #60, Hadith #85)

## 627: ⚔️ Battle of Trench

</summary>

The Battle of the Trench (Ghazwat al-Khandaq), also known as the Battle of Khandaq (معركة الخندق, ) and the Battle of the Confederates, was a 27-day-long defense by Muslims of Yathrib (now Medina) from Arab and Jewish tribes. The strength of the confederate armies is estimated at around 10,000 men with six hundred horses and some camels, while the Medinan defenders numbered 3,000.

The reason for this battle was to save Medina from attack, after Banu Nazir and Banu Qurayzah tribes formed an alliance with the Quraysh to attack him as revenge for expelling them from Medina during the Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa and Invasion of Banu Nadir.

The outnumbered Muslims opted to engage in a defensive battle by digging deep trenches to act as a barrier along the northern front. The tactic of a defensive trench was introduced by Salman the Persian. Every capable Muslim in Medina including Muhammad contributed to digging the massive trench in six days. The ditch was dug on the northern side only, as the rest of Medina was surrounded by rocky mountains and trees 🌳🌳, impenetrable to large armies (especially cavalry). The digging of the ditch coincided with a near-famine in Medina. Women and children were moved to the inner city. The Medinans harvested all their crops early, so the Confederate armies would have to rely on their own food reserves.

Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Muslim-allied Medinan Jews, Banu Qurayza, to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organized defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco.

</br><img src="/Battle_of_Trench.png" alt="Battle og the Trench"></br> 

The trench, together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederacy's cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. 

### Siege of Medina
The siege of Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 20 nights. Adding in the six days of trench-building, the entire operation lasted 27 days and was contained within a single month (5 Shawwal-1 Dhu al-Qi'dah). Since sieges were uncommon in Arabian warfare, the arriving Confederates were unprepared to deal with the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered on either side of the trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.

The Quraysh veterans grew impatient with the deadlock. A group of militants led by ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Wudd (who was thought to be equal to a thousand men in fighting) and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl attempted to thrust through the trench and managed to effect a crossing, occupying a marshy area near the hillock of Sala. 'Amr challenged the Muslims to a duel. In response, Ali ibn Abi Talib accepted the challenge, and was sent by Muhammad to fight. As Ali went to fight Amr ibn Abd Wudd, Muhammad said about Ali, "He is the embodiment of all Faith who is going to an encounter with the embodiment of all Unbelief."

Both the fighters got lost in the dust as the duel became intense. Finally, the soldiers heard screams which hinted at decisive blows, but it was unclear which of the two was successful. The slogan, 'Allahu Akbar' (God is the greatest) from the dust confirmed Ali's victory. The Confederates were forced to withdraw in a state of panic and confusion. Ali, as per his principles, allowed Amr's entourage to retreat; Ali never pursued a fleeing enemy.

The Confederate army made several other attempts to cross the trench during the night but repeatedly failed.

#### Treachery of Banu Qurayza
The Confederates attempted several simultaneous attacks, in particular by trying to persuade the Banu Qurayza to attack the Muslims from the south. From the Confederates, Huyayy ibn Akhtab, a Khaybarian, the leader of the exiled tribe Banu Nadir, returned to Medina seeking their support against the Muslims.

So far the Banu Qurayza had tried their best to remain neutral, and were very hesitant about joining the Confederates since they had earlier made a pact with Muhammad.When Huyayy approached them, their leader refused to allow him entry.

Huyayy eventually managed to enter and persuade them that the Muslims would surely be overwhelmed. The sight of the vast Confederate armies, surging over the land with soldiers and horses as far as the eye could see, swung the Qurayza opinion in the favor of the Confederacy.

News of the Qurayzah's supposed renunciation of the pact with Muhammad leaked out, and Umar promptly informed Muhammad. Such suspicions were reinforced by the movement of enemy troops towards the strongholds of the Qurayza. Muhammad became anxious about their conduct, and realised the grave potential danger the Qurayza posed. Because of his pact with the Qurayza, he had not bothered to make defensive preparations along the Muslims' border with the tribe. The Qurayza also possessed weaponry: 1,500 swords, 2,000 lances, 300 suits of armour, and 500 shields.

Muhammad sent three leading Muslims to bring him details of the recent developments. He advised the men to openly declare their findings, should they find the Banu Qurayza to be kind, so as to increase the morale of the Muslim fighters. However, he warned against spreading the news of a possible breach of the pact on the Qurayza's part, so as to avoid any panic within Muslim ranks.

#### Medina Cryisis

Muhammad attempted to hide his knowledge of the activities of Banu Qurayza; however, rumors soon spread of a massive assault on the city of Medina from Qurayza's side which severely demoralized the Medinans.

The Muslims found themselves in greater difficulties by day. Food was running short, and nights were colder. The lack of sleep made matters worse. So tense was the situation that, for the first time, the canonical daily prayers were neglected by the Muslim community. Only at night, when the attacks stopped due to darkness, could they resume their regular worship. According to Ibn Ishaq, the situation became serious and fear was everywhere.

Quran describes the situation in surah Al-Ahzab:

    ˹Remember˺ when they came at you from east and west, when your eyes grew wild ˹in horror˺ and your hearts jumped into your throats, and you entertained ˹conflicting˺ thoughts about Allah.
    
    Then and there the believers were put to the test, and were violently shaken.
    
    And ˹remember˺ when the hypocrites and those with sickness in their hearts said, “Allah and His Messenger have promised us nothing but delusion!”
    
    And ˹remember˺ when a group of them said, “O people of Yathrib! There is no point in you staying ˹here˺, so retreat!” Another group of them asked the Prophet’s permission ˹to leave˺, saying, “Our homes are vulnerable,” while ˹in fact˺ they were not vulnerable. They only wished to flee.
    
    Had their city been sacked from all sides and they had been asked to abandon faith, they would have done so with little hesitation.
    
    They had already pledged to Allah earlier never to turn their backs ˹in retreat˺. And a pledge to Allah must be answered for.
    
    Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Fleeing will not benefit you if you ˹try to˺ escape a natural or violent death. ˹If it is not your time,˺ you will only be allowed enjoyment for a little while.”
    
    Ask ˹them, O  Prophet˺, “Who can put you out of Allah’s reach if He intends to harm you or show you mercy?” They can never find any protector or helper besides Allah.
    
    Allah knows well those among you who discourage ˹others from fighting˺, saying ˹secretly˺ to their brothers, “Stay with us,” and who themselves hardly take part in fighting.
    
    ˹They are˺ totally unwilling to assist you. When danger comes, you see them staring at you with their eyes rolling like someone in the throes of death. But once the danger is over, they slash you with razor-sharp tongues, ravenous for ˹worldly˺ gains. Such people have not ˹truly˺ believed, so Allah has rendered their deeds void. And that is easy for Allah.
    
    They ˹still˺ think that the enemy alliance has not ˹yet˺ withdrawn. And if the allies were to come ˹again˺, the hypocrites would wish to be away in the desert among nomadic Arabs, ˹only˺ asking for news about you ˹believers˺. And if the hypocrites were in your midst, they would hardly take part in the fight.
    
    Indeed, in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent example for whoever has hope in Allah and the Last Day, and remembers Allah often.
    
    When the believers saw the enemy alliance, they said, “This is what Allah and His Messenger had promised us. The promise of Allah and His Messenger has come true.” And this only increased them in faith and submission.
    Surah Al-Ahzab 33:10-22

### Muslims Response

Immediately after hearing the rumors about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 horsemen (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created the illusion of a large force.

The crisis showed Muhammad that many of his men had reached the limits of their endurance. He sent word to Ghatafan, trying to pay for their defection and offering them a third of Medina's date harvest if they withdrew. Although the Ghatafan demanded half, they eventually agreed to negotiate with Muhammad on those terms. Before Muhammad began the order of drafting the agreement, he consulted the Medinan leaders. They sharply rejected the terms of the agreement, protesting Medina had never sunk to such levels of ignominy. The negotiations were broken off. While the Ghatafan did not retreat they had compromised themselves by entering into negotiations with Medina, and the Confederacy's internal dissension had thereby been increased.

At about that point, Muhammad received a visit from Nuaym ibn Masud, an Arab leader who was well-respected by the entire confederacy, but who had, unknown to them, secretly converted to Islam. Muhammad asked him to end the siege by creating discord amongst Confederates.

> William Montgomery Watt:
> The whole was a battle of wits in which Muslims had the best of it; without cost to themselves they weakened the enemy and increased the dissension.

Nuaym then came up with an efficient stratagem. He first went to the Banu Qurayza and warned them about the intentions of the rest of the Confederacy. If the siege fails, he said, the Confederacy will not be afraid to abandon the Jews, leaving them at the mercy of Muhammad. The Qurayza should thus demand Confederate leaders as hostages in return for cooperation. This advice touched upon the fears the Qurayza had already harbored.

Next Nuaym went to Abu Sufyan, the Confederate leader, warning him that the Qurayza had defected to Muhammad. He stated that the tribe intended to ask the Confederacy for hostages, ostensibly in return for cooperation, but really to hand over to Muhammad. Thus the Confederacy should not give a single man a hostage. Nuaym repeated the same message to other tribes in the Confederacy

### Collapse of the Confederacy
Nuaym's stratagem worked. After consulting, the Confederate leaders sent Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl to the Qurayza, signaling a united invasion of Medina. The Qurayza, however, demanded hostages as a guarantee that the Confederacy would not desert them. The Confederacy, considering that the Qurayza might give the hostage to Muhammad, refused. Messages were repeatedly sent back and forth between the parties, but each held to its position stubbornly.

Abu Sufyan summoned Huyayy ibn Akhtab, informing him of Qurayza's response. Huyayy was taken aback, and Abu Sufyan branded him as a "traitor". Fearing for his life, Huyayy fled to the Qurayza's strongholds.

The Bedouins, the Ghatafan, and other Confederates from Najd had already been compromised by Muhammad's negotiations. They had taken part in the expedition in hopes of plunder, rather than for personal reasons. They lost hope as chances of success dwindled, uninterested in continuing the siege. The two confederate armies were marked by recriminations and mutual distrust.

The provisions of the Confederate armies were running out. Horses and camels were dying of hunger and wounds. For days the weather had been exceptionally cold and wet. Violent winds blew out the campfires, taking away from the Confederate army their source of heat. The Muslim camp, however, was sheltered from such winds. The enemy’s tents were torn up, their fires were extinguished, the sand and rain beat in their faces and they were terrified by the portents against them. They had already well nigh fallen out among themselves. During the night the Confederate armies withdrew, and by morning the ground was cleared of all enemy forces.

### Aftermath

The siege was a "battle of wits", in which the Muslims tactically overcame their opponents while suffering very few casualties. Efforts to defeat the Muslims failed, and Islam became influential in the region. As a consequence, the Muslim army besieged the area of the Banu Qurayza tribe, leading to their surrender.

The defeat caused the Meccans to lose their trade and much of their prestige.

Following the retreat of the Confederate army, the Banu Qurayza neighborhoods were besieged by the Muslims for their treachery. After a 25-day siege of their neighborhood, the Banu Qurayza unconditionally surrendered. When the Banu Qurayza tribe surrendered, the Muslim army seized their stronghold and their possessions for their acts. On the request of the Banu Aus, who were allied to the Qurayza, Muhammad chose one of them, Sa'ad ibn Mu'adh, as an arbitrator to pronounce judgment upon them. Sa'ad, who later died of his wounds from the battle, decreed the sentence, in which some of the men fighters shall be killed and some of their women and children enslaved. Muhammad approved of this decision, and the next day the sentence was carried out.

The failure of the siege marked the beginning of Muhammad's undoubted ascendency in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength to dislodge Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.

> On the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. clans) the Prophet said, (After this battle) we will go to attack them (i.e. the infidels) and they will not come to attack us."
> Sahih al-Bukhari 4109

## Abu Dharr Al-Ghifari comes to Medina with all his tribe

</summary>

Abu Dharr hears the news about prophet Muhammad preaching in Mecca and sends his brother to the messenger and his brother returns and says 'I found a man who recites beautiful kalam and I don't think it's poetry, and I also saw that he teaches good things, good characteristics'. Then Abu Dharr comes himself to the prophet Muhammadﷺ   and becomes a muslim. The prophet Muhammadﷺ   sends him back to his tribe to preach and wait for the news of the victory of Islam. 

According to some narrations, Abu Dharr was the fifth person to embrase Islam. And his tribe Al-Ghifar were known to be bandits who used to ride caravans. 

More than 15 years later, a tribe of horses and camels rush to Medina and muslims are scared because they think an army is coming to attack muslims. The travellers were no other than the tribe of Al Ghifarr who all became muslims and came to serve the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  .

Abu Dharr says: "Oh Messenger of Allah, here is every single one of the Al Ghifarr." and prophet Muhammad ﷺ   replies: "May Allah forgive the entirety of Ghifarr."

> The hadith says: "If anybody wants to see the abstinent from the dunya of Eesa (as), then he should look at Abu Dharr al-Ghifari".

## 628: Treaty of Hudaybiyyah

</summary>

Treaty of Hudaybiyyah is a peace agreement signed between prophet Muhammad'sﷺ   Muslims and the people of Mecca.

The Kaaba in Makkah was built by the Prophets Abraham and his son, Ismael. They consecrated it as the spiritual center of the world of the monotheists. And now Kaaba was the “Qibla” of the Muslims which means that they had to turn toward it when offering their prayers. But the custodians of the Kaaba were the idolaters of Makkah, and they were using it as the national pantheon of polytheism, housing in it 360 idols of their tribes.

By ancient Arab custom, everyone was free to visit the Kaaba – unarmed. Also, by ancient custom, fighting of any kind was prohibited during the four sacred months of the year. One of these months was Zilqa'ada, the 11th month of the calendar.

The Muslims longed to see what for them was the House of God. Therefore, in Zilqa'ada of the sixth year after the Migration, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   declared that he would visit Makkah to perform Umra or the Lesser Pilgrimage – unarmed but with his followers. With this intent, he left Medina in late February A.D. 628 with 1400 of his followers. They had taken camels and other animals for sacrifice but no weapons except their swords.

When this caravan of the pilgrims reached the outskirts of Makkah, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was informed that the idolaters would not allow him to enter the city, and that, they would use force to prevent him from doing so. This report caused great agitation among the Muslims. They halted near a well in a place called Hudaybiyya in the north of Makkah.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   sent a message to the Quraysh that he wished only to make the customary seven circuits of the Kaaba, sacrifice the animals, and then return to Medina, with his followers. The Quraysh did not agree. Many other messages were sent but the Quraysh said that they would not admit the Muslims into Makkah.

Eventually, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   ordered Umar bin al-Khattab to go to Makkah to explain to the idolaters the purpose of the visit of the Muslims, to assure them that they (the Muslims) had no intention of fighting against anyone, and to give them a pledge that after performing the rites of Umra they would leave Makkah immediately and would return to Medina.

But Umar refused to go. He said that there was no one in Makkah to protect him. He suggested, however, that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   ought to send Uthman bin Affan with his message to Makkah since the idolaters would not do him any harm.

The idolaters welcomed Uthman and told him that he was free to perform the Umra. But he said that he alone could not perform Umra, and that they had to admit the \prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and all the Muslims with him, into the city. This was not acceptable to the Quraysh, and it was reported that they had arrested him. It was even rumored that they had killed him.

When the rumors of Uthman's execution reached prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , he construed the action of the Quraysh as an ultimatum, and asked the Muslims to renew their pledge of fealty to him. All Muslims pledged their obedience to the Messenger of God regardless of the events which might take place thenceforth.

This pledge is called the “Pledge of Ridhwan” or the “Covenant of Fealty,” and those Muslims who gave it, are called the “Companions of the Tree,” because prophet Muhammad ﷺ   stood under a tree as they filed past him renewing their oath of allegiance to him. Their numbers are given as 1400.

The resolution of the Muslims to dare the consequences appears to have put the Quraysh in a more reasonable frame of mind, as they realized that their intransigence could lead to unnecessary bloodshed. Uthman, it turned out, had not been killed as it had been rumored but had only been arrested, and now they released him – an act reflecting a change in their attitude.

Also reflective of this change was the selection by them of one, Suhayl bin Amr, whom they sent to the camp of the Muslims to conclude a treaty with prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . Suhayl was a man known to be a skillful but not an inflexible negotiator.

Suhayl arrived in Hudaybiyya and opened negotiations with prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . After long and wearisome discussions and debate they succeeded in hammering out a treaty.

### Conditional points of the treaty

After a long discussion, both parties agreed with some conditional points, such as:

1. The Messenger of Allah will have to return to Medina instead of having entered Mecca that year. The Muslim shall perform their pilgrimage in the upcoming year and they would stay in peace at Mecca for three days including the years onward with no arms except sheathed swords.
2. There will be peace between both parties for ten years, whereby during this period all the people may enjoy safety and harmony.
3. Whoever wishes to enter into a covenant with the Prophet will be allowed to do so, and whoever wishes to enter into a covenant with the Quraish will be allowed to do so. Whoever enters into any one of the parties will be considered part of that party. Likewise, any sort of aggression against them will be considered aggression against that party.
4. Whoever flees to prophet Muhammad ﷺ   from Mecca without the permission of his guardians will be sent back to the Quraysh, but whoever comes to the Quraysh from the Muslims will not be sent back to the Muslims. 

The writer of the treaty was Ali Ibn Abi Talib. Dictating to Ali, the Prophet said: “Write, In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Beneficent.” Suhayl, the Makkan envoy, at once raised objection, and said, “Do not write this. Instead, write, ‘In Thy name O Allah.'“ The Prophet complied with this demand.

The Prophet next asked Ali to write: “This is a treaty of peace between Muhammad, the Messenger of God and the Quraysh...” Suhayl again objected, and said: “If we had acknowledged you a messenger of God, why would we be fighting against you? Therefore, do not write the words, ‘the Messenger of God,' and write only your own name and the name of your father.”

The Prophet was agreeable to comply with this demand also but Ali had already written the words, “Muhammad, the Messenger of God,” and he refused to delete them. He said to his master: “This high rank has been bestowed upon you by Allah Himself, and I shall never delete the words ‘Messenger of Allah' with my hand.” Thereupon, the Prophet took the pen in his own hand, and deleted the words which were offensive to the idolaters.

The Treaty of Hudaybiyya was signed on two copies, one for each party.

The Treaty is very important in Islam, as it was an indirect recognition of the Islamic state in Medina. The treaty also allowed the Muslims who were still in Mecca to practice Islam publicly. Further, as there was no longer a constant struggle between the Muslims and the polytheists, many people saw Islam in a new light, which led to many more people accepting Islam.

In addition, the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah paved the way for the conquering of other tribes, through the use of treaties with the Muslims. The treaty also serves as an example that Islam was not merely spread with the sword as prophet Muhammad ﷺ   had an army that could have attacked Mecca, but prophet Muhammad ﷺ   chose to make a peace treaty. Only after the polytheists broke the treaty, he marched on Makkah and conquered the polytheists.

The oath that prophet Muhammad ﷺ   took "under the tree" at al-Hudaybiyyah made him a true ruler over parts of western Arabia. In early Islamic Egypt, having a forefather who had "pledged allegiance under the tree 🌳" conferred considerable social prestige.

Umar and some others were angry at the idea of treating with these pagans. The future caliph came to upbraid the Prophet. He declared later that if he had a hundred men on his side, he would have seceded. But prophet Muhammad ﷺ   was immovable. 

The Muslims were sulkily silent when told by prophet Muhammad ﷺ   to shave their heads and offer their sacrifices. At last (by the advice of his wife, Umm Salamah), he performed the operations himself, and his followers did the same.

His mission accomplished, prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , the Messenger of God, left Hudaybiyya with the pilgrims, to return to Medina. He was still at seven days' journey from Medina, when a verse of the Quran was revealed about the Treaty of Hudaybiyah:

    "Verily we have granted thee a manifest victory"
    Quran Surah Fath 48:1

    Allah's Good Pleasure was on the Believers when they swore Fealty to thee under the Tree: He knew what was in their hearts, and He sent down Tranquillity to them; and He rewarded them with a speedy Victory;

    And many gains will they acquire (besides): and Allah is Exalted in Power, Full of Wisdom.

    Allah has promised you many gains that ye shall acquire, and He has given you these beforehand; and He has restrained the hands of men from you; that it may be a Sign for the Believers, and that He may guide you to a Straight Path;

    And other gains (there are), which are not within your power, but which Allah has compassed: and Allah has power over all things.
    
    If the Unbelievers should fight you, they would certainly turn their backs; then would they find neither protector nor helper.

    (Such has been) the practice (approved) of Allah already in the past: no change wilt thou find in the practice (approved) of Allah.

    And it is He Who has restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the midst of Makka, after that He gave you the victory over them. And Allah sees well all that ye do.

    They are the ones who denied Revelation and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the sacrificial animals, detained from reaching their place of sacrifice. Had there not been believing men and believing women whom ye did not know that ye were trampling down and on whose account a crime would have accrued to you without (your) knowledge, (Allah would have allowed you to force your way, but He held back your hands) that He may admit to His Mercy whom He will. If they had been apart, We should certainly have punished the Unbelievers among them with a grievous Punishment.

    While the Unbelievers got up in their hearts heat and cant - the heat and cant of ignorance,- Allah sent down His Tranquillity to his Messenger and to the Believers, and made them stick close to the command of self-restraint; and well were they entitled to it and worthy of it. And Allah has full knowledge of all things.

    Truly did Allah fulfil the vision for His Messenger: ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear. For He knew what ye knew not, and He granted, besides this, a speedy victory.

    It is He Who has sent His Messenger with Guidance and the Religion of Truth, to proclaim it over all religion: and enough is Allah for a Witness.

    Muhammad is the messenger of Allah; and those who are with him are strong against Unbelievers, (but) compassionate amongst each other. Thou wilt see them bow and prostrate themselves (in prayer), seeking Grace from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. On their faces are their marks, (being) the traces of their prostration. This is their similitude in the Taurat; and their similitude in the Gospel is: like a seed which sends forth its blade, then makes it strong; it then becomes thick, and it stands on its own stem, (filling) the sowers with wonder and delight. As a result, it fills the Unbelievers with rage at them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness, and a great Reward.
    Quran, Surah Fath Ayah 18-29

## 628-629: Letters to Kings

</summary>

Around the end of the 6 AH and the beginning of the 7 AH (628 CE), prophet Muhammad ﷺ   sent letters to various heads of state asking them to accept Islam and to worship only one God. Notable among them were Heraclius, the emperor of Byzantium; Khosrau II, the emperor of Persia; the Negus of Ethiopia; Muqawqis, the ruler of Egypt; Harith Gassani, the governor of Syria; and Munzir ibn Sawa, the ruler of Bahrain.

E. Von Grunebaum

> In 629, Mohammed sent letters to six rulers - the Persian king, the Byzantine emperor, the Negus of Abyssinia, the governor of Egypt, a Ghassanid prince, and a chief of the Banu Hanifa in south-east Arabia, inviting them to Islam. (Classical Islam - A History 600-1258)
>
> Muhammad was God's Messenger not only for the Arabs but for the whole world. It was his duty to deliver God's last message to all mankind, and he did. Professor Margoliouth, however, considers these letters a prelude to aggression and conquest. He says:
>
> About the time of the campaign of Khaibar, he (Mohammed) published his program of world-conquest by sending letters to the rulers of whose fame he had heard. (Mohammed and the Rise of Islam, 1931)
>
It is true that the program of Muhammad, the Messenger of God, was one of “world-conquest,” but not by force of arms. His aim was to conquer the minds and the hearts of men and women, which Islam did in his day, and is still doing today.
>
> In sending these letters, the Prophet was prompted by his desire that all men should live in obedience to the commandments and laws of God. Obedience to those commandments and laws alone can guarantee the peace, happiness and welfare of mankind in this world, and its salvation in the Hereafter.

## 629: Conquest of Khaybar

</summary>
  
In the 6 AH, **Khalid ibn al-Walid** accepted Islam who later was to play a decisive role in the expansion of Islamic empire. In the 7 AH, the Jewish leaders of Khaybar – a place some 200 miles from Medina – started instigating the Jewish and Ghatafan tribes against Medina. When negotiation failed, Muhammad ordered the blockade of the Khaybar forts, and its inhabitants surrendered after some days. The lands of Khaybar came under Muslim control. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   however granted the Jewish request to retain the lands under their control. 

<aside>
Khaybar is a township 90 miles north of Medina, in a harra or volcanic tract, well-watered with many springs issuing forth from its basaltic rocks. It has an excellent irrigation system and produces rich harvests of dates and grain.

Long before the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , the valley of Khaybar and other valleys in its north and south, were colonized by the Jews. As noted before, these Jews were not only the best farmers of the country, they were also its leaders in industry and business, and they enjoyed a monopoly of the armaments industry.

In the times of the Prophet ﷺ  , the best arsenals of Arabia were all in Khaybar. Those Jews who had been banished from Medina, had also resettled in Khaybar, and they were noted for their skills in metallurgy.
</aside>

The Qaynuqa were banished from Medina. Chiefly they were metalworkers, having learned the art of beating out the splendid shining armor, the moon-curved swords and sun-catching helmets that glorified warfare in the desert. They made fine bronze armor, beaten and burnished, with helmets to match and gleaming swords whose swift cut could make the very air whistle. (Muhammad – the Messenger of God)

The Jews of Khaybar also heard about the Treaty of Hudaybiyya and its terms. Just as the Quraysh in Makkah and Umar bin al-Khattab and some other “hawks” among the Muslims in Medina had interpreted the treaty as the “surrender” of the Muslims, so also did the Jews of Khaybar consider it a symptom of the incipient decline of the power of the State of Medina.

Banking on this theory of “decline,” they began to instigate the Arab tribes between Khaybar and Medina to attack the Muslims. One of these tribes was the Ghatafan, the allies of the Jews of Khaybar.

They began to send their raiding expeditions into the pastures around Medina. One of these pastures belonged to the Prophet himself. On one occasion, the son of Abu Dharr el-Ghiffari was grazing the camels of the Prophet ﷺ   when the Ghatafan struck. They killed him, and captured his mother who was with him, and they drove with them the herd of camels. The Muslims, however, were able, just in time, to overtake the marauders and to rescue the wife of Abu Dharr el-Ghiffari.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   decided to put an end to these gratuitous provocation. He thought that it would not be prudent to wait until the Jews and their allies laid another siege to Medina, and that it would be better to forestall them. He, therefore, ordered the Muslims to mobilize, and to march on Khaybar.

In September 628 the Prophet ﷺ   left Medina with 1600 soldiers. Some Muslim women also accompanied the army to work as nurses and to give first aid to the wounded and the sick.

Khaybar had eight fortresses. The strongest and the most important of them all was the fortress of al-Qamus. The captain of its garrison was a famous champion called Merhab. He had, under his command, the best fighting men of Khaybar, and they were the best-equipped soldiers of the time in all Arabia.

The campaign of Khaybar was one of the greatest. The masses of Jews living in Khaybar were the strongest, the richest, and the best equipped for war of all the peoples of Arabia. (The Life of Muhammad, Cairo, 1935)

The Muslims, however, were able to capture all the fortresses of Khaybar except al-Qamus which proved to be impregnable.

Ibn Ishaq:
Burayda b. Sufyan b. Farwa al-Aslami told me from his father Sufyan b. Amr b. Al-Akwa: the Apostle ﷺ   sent Abu Bakr with his banner against one of the forts of Khaybar. He fought but returned having suffered losses and not taken it. On the morrow he sent Umar and the same thing happened. The Apostle said: “Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man who loves Allah and His Apostle. Allah will conquer it by his means. He is no runaway.” Next day he gave the flag to Ali. (The Life of the Messenger of God)

Ali was no giant, but he made up for his lack of height by his great breadth and prodigious strength. Today he was formidable in a scarlet tunic over which he wore his shining breastplate and backplate. On his head gleamed a spiked helmet encrusted with silver. In his right hand he brandished Mohammed's own scimitar, Dhu'l-Fiqar, which had been entrusted to him with the black banner. Ali led his forces and fought valiantly. In the engagement, he lost his armor and, shielding himself with a portal he had seized, he continued to fight until the fortress was stormed by his troops. The same portal was used by Ali as a little bridge to enable the Muslim soldiers to enter the houses within the fortress.

### The Results of the Conquest of Khaybar

The conquest of Khaybar is a landmark in the history of Islam as it is the beginning of the Islamic State and Empire.

Khaybar was the first campaign in which non-Muslims were made the subjects of the Islamic State. It was the first time that the principles of government in Islam were defined and applied. Therefore, Khaybar is the first successful campaign of Islam.

At Khaybar, the nascent Islamic State acquired new subjects and new territories. It was the beginning, not only of the Islamic State but also of its expansion. 

Before the conquest of Khaybar, the Muslims were destitutes or semi-destitutes. Khaybar suddenly made them rich. 

The Muhajireen in Medina had no means of making a living and therefore had no steady income. They had barely managed to survive until the conquest of Khaybar. Once Khaybar was conquered, there was a sudden change in their fortunes.

The conquest of Khaybar conferred unlimited benefits upon the Muslims; some of them were:
1. Immense quantities of gold and silver that the Jews had been accumulating for many generations.
2. The finest arsenals of Arabia containing the newest weapons of the times such as swords, spears, lances, maces, shields, armor, bows and arrows.
3. Vast herds of horses, camels and cattle, and flocks of sheep and goats.
4. Rich arable lands with palm groves.

> Imam Bukhari has quoted Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab as saying: “We were hungry at all times until the conquest of Khaybar.” 

> Also, imam Bukhari has quoted Aisha, the wife of the Prophet ﷺ  , as saying: “It was not until the conquest of Khaybar that I could eat dates to my heart's content.”

## 🕋 Umrah of the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   (The First Pilgrimage)

</summary>

In 629 CE (7 AH), in accordance with the terms of the Hudaybiyyah treaty, Muhammad and the Muslims performed their lesser pilgrimage (Umrah) to Mecca and left the city after three days. Umrah of Dhu'l-Qada (Pilgrimage of the 11th month) was the first pilgrimage that the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the Muslims made after the Migration to Medina. It took place on the morning of the fourth day of Dhu al-Qi'dah 7 AH (629 CE), after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah 6 AH (628 CE). The entire event was three days long.

A pilgrimage that occurs during the month of Dhu al-Hijjah is named a "major pilgrimage", or just "pilgrimage" (حَـجّ, Ḥajj), while pilgrimages of all other months are called "minor pilgrimage" (عُـمْـرَة, ‘Umrah).

Ar-Raḥīq Al-Makhtūm ( ٱلـرَّحِـيْـق ٱلْـمَـخْـتُـوْم, "The Sealed Nectar"), in the chapter The Compensatory ‘Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) the event is described as follows:

> When Dhul Qa‘da month approached towards the close of the seventh year A.H., the Prophet ordered his people, and the men who witnessed Al-Hudaibiyah Truce Treaty in particular, to make preparations to perform the lesser pilgrimage. He proceeded with 2000 men besides some women and children [Fath Al-Bari 7/700], and 60 camels 🐫🐫🐫 for sacrifice, to visit the Holy Sanctuary in Makkah. The Muslims took their weapons with them fearing the treachery of the Quraishites, but left them with a party of two hundred men at a place some eight miles from Makkah. They entered the city with the swords in their scabbards [Za'd Al-Ma'ad 2/151; Fath Al-Bari 7/700], with the Prophet at their head on his she-camel 🐫, Al-Qaswa’, while the surrounding Companions attentively focusing their look on him, all saying: "Here I am! at Your service O Allâh!" The Quraishites had left the place and retired to their tents on the adjoining hills. The Muslims performed the usual circumambulation around Kaaba 🕋 vigorously and briskly; and on recommendation by the Prophet they did their best to appear strong and steadfast in their circumambulation as the polytheists had spread rumours that they were weak because the fever of Yathrib (Madinah) had sapped their strength. They were ordered to run in the first three rounds and then walk in the remaining ones. The Makkans meanwhile aligned on the top of Qu‘aiqa‘an Mount watching the Muslims, tongue-tied at witnessing their strength and devotion.

## Battle of Mu'tah

</summary>

The Battle of Mu'tah (Arabic: مَعْرَكَة مُؤْتَة, romanized: Maʿrakah Muʿtah, or Arabic: غَزْوَة مُؤْتَة Ghazwah Muʿtah) took place in September 629 (1 Jumada al-Awwal 8 AH), between the forces of Muhammad and the army of the Byzantine Empire and their Ghassanid vassals. It took place in the village of Mu'tah at the east of the Jordan River and Karak in Karak Governorate.

In 629 the christian arab tribe of ghassan was ruled by Shorhail, a prince who was a vassal of the Byzantine emperor. He was one of those rulers who had received letters from Muhammad Mustafa inviting them to accept Islam. In those days he held court in Mootah, a town east of the Dead Sea. When the Prophet's emissary, Harith bin Umayr, arrived at his court bearing the letter for him, he ordered his execution.

The murder of Harith bin Umayr was an unprovoked outrage, and the killing of an ambassador is considered an unpardonable crime in many nations. The Prophet decided to take punitive action. He equipped an army of 3000 men, and sent it under the command of his friend and freedman, Zayd bin Haritha, to Mootah, to demand reparations. At the same time, he designated a chain of command and responsibility. In the event of Zayd's death, the command of the army was to pass on to Jaafer ibn Abi Talib. If he too were to be killed, then the third general was to be Abdullah ibn Rawaha.

When Shorhail heard that an army was approaching his capital from Medina, he also mobilized his men, and was soon ready to meet it. He deployed his troops on the south-side, out of the walls of Mootah. They were composed of the Roman garrison of Mootah, and the freshly raised tribal levies. When the Muslims arrived and took stock of the situation, they realized that it was going to be an unequal fight as they were heavily outnumbered by the enemy.

The Muslim leaders held a war council. Zayd bin Haritha proposed that they immediately send a messenger to the Prophet apprising him of the imbalance in the strength of the two forces, and requesting him to send reinforcements.

But Abdullah bin Rawaha opposed him, and said that the decision to fight or not to fight did not rest upon their numbers, and if they were outnumbered by the enemy, it was immaterial for them. “We fight to win the crown of martyrdom, and not the laurels of victory, and here is our chance; let us not miss it,” he said.

Abdullah bin Rawaha clinched the debate with his powerful argument, and the Muslims advanced to meet the enemy. The Muslims engaged the Byzantines at their camp by the village of Musharif and then withdrew towards Mu'tah. It was here that the two armies fought. Some Muslim sources report that the battle was fought in a valley between two heights, which negated the Byzantines' numerical superiority.

At the very first clash of arms, Zayd bin Haritha, the first general of the Muslims, was killed. Jaghfar ibn Abi Talib took the banner. WJaghfar fought heroically and was also killed. His body was brought into the camp. Abdullah bin Umar bin al-Khattab, who was with the army, says that he counted the wounds on the hero's body, and found more than fifty of them, and they were all in front. Jaafer had dared sword and spear even after the loss of his arms, but had not flinched.

When all three generals appointed by the Prophet had been killed, the Muslims were left leaderless for a time. Then Khalid bin al-Walid who was also fighting in the ranks, seized the banner, and managed to rally the Muslims.

At night the armies disengaged, and this gave him the opportunity to reorganize his men. He is said to have fought a defensive action on the following day but realizing that it was impossible to win a victory, ordered a retreat from Mootah, and succeeded in bringing the remnants of the army back to Medina.

After the Muslim forces arrived at Medina, they were reportedly berated for withdrawing and accused of fleeing. Salamah ibn Hisham, brother of Amr ibn Hishām (Abu Jahl) was reported to have prayed at home rather than going to the mosque to avoid having to explain himself. Muhammad ordered them to stop, saying that they would return to fight the Byzantines again.

Next morning in the mosque, the Prophet announced that he had, in a vision, seen the martyrs of Mootah in Paradise, reclining upon couches, but Jaafer was there in the guise of an angel with two wings, stained on their feathers with the blood of martyrdom. It was as a result of this vision that the martyr has since been known as Jaafer the Flyer, Jaafer at-Tayyar.

## 629: Mecca becomes Muslim

</summary>

### Quraish break Treaty of Hudaybiyah

Muhammad Husayn Haykal:
As soon as Khalid and the army returned to Medinah without the proofs of victory (at the battle of Mootah), they were called deserters. Many soldiers and commanders felt so humiliated that they stayed at home in order not to be seen and insulted in public. The campaign of Mootah gave the Quraysh the impression that the Muslims and their power had now been destroyed and that both their dignity and the fear which they previously inspired in others had all but disappeared.

This made the Quraysh incline strongly to the conditions prevalent before the Treaty of Hudaybiyya. They thought that they could now launch a war against which the Muslims were incapable of defending themselves, not to speak of counterattacking or making retaliation. (The Life of Muhammad, Cairo, 1935)

According to the terms of the Treaty of Hudaybiyya, the Arab tribes were free to enter into treaty relations with either the Muslims or the Quraysh. Taking advantage of this stipulation, the tribe of Banu Khoza'a wrote a treaty of friendship with the Prophet of Islam, and another tribe – Banu Bakr – became an ally of the Quraysh. Hostility had existed between these two tribes since pre-Islamic times but now both had to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Hudaybiyya, and to refrain from attacking each other

But eighteen months after the Treaty of Hudaybiyya had been signed, a band of the warriors of Banu Bakr suddenly attacked Banu Khoza'a in their homes at night. The time of this attack is given as late Rajab of 8 A.H. (November 629).

The Khoza'a had done nothing to provoke this attack. They took refuge in the precincts of the Kaaba but their enemies pursued them even there, and killed a number of them. Others saved their lives by seeking the protection of Budail bin Waraqa and his friend, Rafa'a, in their houses, in Makkah.

In 629 CE, the Banu Bakr tribe, an ally of Quraysh, attacked the Muslims' ally tribe Banu Khuza'a, and killed several of them. The Quraysh openly helped Banu Bakr in their attack, which in return, violated the terms of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. Of the three options now advanced by Muhammad, the Quraish decided to cancel the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. Muhammad started taking preparation for Mecca campaign. 

The hotheads of the Quraysh had been quick to repudiate the Treaty of Hudaybiyya but very soon their more realistic and discreet leaders realized that the answer they had sent to Medina was a blunder as it had been dictated, not by prudence and sagacity, but by presumption and arrogance.

And when they thought of what the consequences of their action could be, they decided to act immediately to avert disaster. But how? After an animated discussion, they agreed that Abu Sufyan should go to Medina, and should try to persuade the Prophet to renew the Treaty of Hudaybiyya.

When Abu Sufyan arrived in Medina, he first went to see his daughter, Umm Habiba – one of the wives of the Prophet. As he was going to sit on a rug, she pulled it from under him, and said: “You are an unclean idolater, and I cannot allow you to sit on the rug of the Messenger of God.” She treated him as if he was an untouchable pariah.

Shaken by such a reception, he left her, and went to the mosque hoping to see the Prophet himself. But the latter did not give him audience. He then solicited the aid of Abu Bakr, Umar and Ali but all of them told him that they could not intercede for him with the Prophet, and he returned to Makkah empty-handed.

The Quraysh had broken the pledge, and the envoys of Khozaa were still in Medina, demanding justice. If the Prophet had condoned the crime of the Quraysh, he would have seriously compromised his own position in the sight of all Arabs. He could not allow this to happen. Eventually, the Prophet decided to capture Makkah, and he ordered the Muslims to mobilize.

### March to Mecca

The army of Islam left Medina on the tenth of Ramadan of 8 A.H. (February 1, 630). The news that an army was marching southwards, spread rapidly in the desert, and even reached Makkah itself. Those members of the clan of Banu Hashim who were still in Makkah, decided, upon hearing this news, to leave the city and to meet the advancing army. Among them were Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet; Aqeel bin Abi Talib, and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith bin Abdul Muttalib, his cousins. They joined the army of Islam, and reentered Makkah with it.

In the afternoon of the 19th of Ramadan, the army arrived in Merr ad-Dharan in the north of Makkah, and halted there to spend the night. At night the Prophet ordered his soldiers to light little fires, and the whole plain lit up with thousands of bonfires.

Abu Sufyan and Hakim bin Hizam had also left Makkah to investigate the reports of the invasion by the Muslims. Riding north on the road to Medina, they also arrived in Merr ad-Dharan, and were dumb-founded to see countless little fires burning in the valley. When they realized they were in the camp of the Muslims, they were greatly troubled not knowing what they could do to save themselves or their city.

Abbas bin Abdul Muttalib also had great anxiety for the safety of the Makkans. He feared that if they offered resistance, they would be massacred. He was riding the white mule of the Prophet through the camp, when at its southern perimeter, he suddenly ran into Abu Sufyan and Hakim bin Hizam.

He told them that they could see the numbers of the Muslims, and that the Quraysh had no power to resist them. Abu Sufyan asked him what he ought to do. Abbas told him to ride behind him on his mule, and that he would take him to the Prophet, and would try to get safe-conduct for him. Hakim bin Hizam returned to Makkah to report on what he had seen and heard. Abbas and Abu Sufyan rode through the Muslim camp Presently, they rode past the tent of Umar, and he wanted to know who were the two visitors.

When Umar recognized Abu Sufyan, he was thrilled, and said to him: “O enemy of God, at last you are in my power, and now I am going to kill you.” But Abbas told him that he (Abu Sufyan) was under his protection. Thereupon Umar rushed to see the Prophet and solicited his permission to kill him. But the Prophet just told Abbas to bring him on the following morning.

Early next morning, Abbas, Abu Sufyan and Umar, all three appeared before the tent of the Prophet. Umar was raring to kill Abu Sufyan but the Prophet restrained him, and invited the latter to accept Islam. Abu Sufyan was not very eager to accept Islam but Abbas told him that if he didn't, then Umar would kill him, and he would never return to Makkah. Faced by the specter of death, Abu Sufyan declared the Shahadah which formally admitted him to the community of the Muslims.

Abbas also requested the Prophet to grant Abu Sufyan some favor which he would equate with a “distinction.” The Prophet said that all those Makkans who would enter Abu Sufyan's house, or would stay in their own houses, or would enter the precincts of the Kaaba, would be safe from all harm. Abu Sufyan was very proud that the Prophet had declared his house to be a sanctuary for the idolaters of Makkah. His latter-day friends and admirers are flaunting his “distinction” right to this day.

### Entering Mecca

It was Friday, Ramadan 20, 8 A.H. (February 11, 630) when the army of Islam broke camp at Merr ad-Dharan, and marched toward Makkah. Abbas and Abu Sufyan stood on the brow of an eminence to watch the squadrons march past them. The latter was much impressed by the order, the discipline, the numbers and the espirit de corps of the formations, and said to Abbas:

“Your nephew has truly won a great kingdom and great power.” Abbas snapped: “Woe to you! This is prophethood and not a kingdom.” Abu Sufyan had never seen such an awesome sight before, and with his pagan reflexes, and extremely limited vision, could interpret it only in terms of material power. But he realized that the game for him and the idolaters was over at last, and the only important thing now was to save his and their lives.

Abu Sufyan rushed back to Makkah, and entering the precincts of the Kaaba, called out aloud: “O Makkans! Muhammad has arrived with his army, and you have no power to oppose him. Those of you who enter my house, would be safe from harm, and now only your unconditional surrender can save you from massacre.”

Abu Sufyan was surrounded by other citizens of Makkah, and one of them asked him: “Your house can accommodate only a few people. How can so many people find sanctuary in it?” He said: “All those people who stay in their own houses or enter the precincts of the Kaaba, would also be safe.” This ordinance meant that all that the idolaters would have to do to save their lives, would be to stay indoors, and to refrain from challenging the invaders.

Mohammed, who knew not what resistance he might meet with, made a careful distribution of his forces as he approached Mecca. While the main body marched directly forward, strong detachments advanced over the hills on each side. To Ali who commanded a large body of cavalry, was confided the sacred banner, which he was to plant on Mount Hadjun, and maintain it there until joined by the Prophet. Express orders were given to all the generals to practice forbearance, and in no instance to make the first attack.

Muhammad, the Messenger of God, entered Makkah from the north. Usama, the son of his friend and the martyr of Mootah, Zayd bin Haritha, was riding pillion with him. Muhammad's head was bowed low, and he was reciting the chapter from Qur’an called “The Victory.”

    Indeed, We have granted you a clear triumph ˹O Prophet˺

    so that Allah may forgive you for your past and future shortcomings, perfect His favour upon you, guide you along the Straight Path,

    and so that Allah will help you tremendously.

    He is the One Who sent down serenity upon the hearts of the believers so that they may increase even more in their faith. To Allah ˹alone˺ belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise.

    So He may admit believing men and women into Gardens under which rivers flow—to stay there forever—and absolve them of their sins. And that is a supreme achievement in the sight of Allah.

    Also ˹so that˺ He may punish hypocrite men and women and polytheistic men and women, who harbour evil thoughts of Allah. May ill-fate befall them! Allah is displeased with them. He has condemned them and prepared for them Hell. What an evil destination!

    To Allah ˹alone˺ belong the forces of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
    Quran, Surah Al-Fath 1-7

Ali carried the banner of Islam as he rode at the head of the cavalry. The Prophet ordered Zubayr bin al-Awwam to enter the city from the west, and Khalid bin al-Walid from the south. He gave strict orders to his army not to kill anyone except in self-defense. He had long desired to destroy the idols in Kaaba but he wished to do so without any bloodshed. His orders were clear and explicit; nevertheless, Khalid killed 28 Makkans at the southern gate of the city. He said he had met resistance.

### Destroying idols in Kaaba

The Muslim occupation of Mecca was virtually bloodless. Khalid bin Waleed killed a few people at the southern gate and was reprimanded by Muhammad for doing so.

Eight years earlier Muhammad had left Makkah as a fugitive with a price on his head, and now he was entering the same city as its conqueror. His manner, however, bespoke not of pride or even of exultation but of gratitude and humility – gratitude to God for His mercy in bestowing success upon His humble slave, and humility in the contemplation of the vanity of worldly glory, and the evanescence of all things human.

The Prophet rode into the precincts of the Kaaba, dismounted from his camel, called his cousin, Ali ibn Abi Talib, and both of them entered the Kaaba, cognizant of the Divine Commandment to the Prophets, Abraham (Ibrahim) and Ismael:

    ...and We covenanted with Abraham and Ismael that they should sanctify My house... (Chapter 2; verse 125)

The Prophet found the House of God (Kaaba) in a state of defilement; it had become a pantheon of 360 idols, and it had to be sanctified. The Prophet knocked down each idol as he read the following verse from Qur’an:

    Truth has come, and Falsehood has vanished. For Falsehood is (by its nature) bound to vanish. (Chapter 17; verse 81)

Narrated Abdullah bin Masud:
> The Prophet ﷺ   entered Mecca and (at that time) there were three hundred-and-sixty idols around the Kaaba. He started stabbing the idols with a stick he had in his hand and reciting: "Truth (Islam) has come and Falsehood (disbelief) has vanished."

### Bilal climbs up the roof of Kaaba and says the adhan

When all the idols had been destroyed, all images had been effaced, and all vestiges of polytheism had been obliterated, Muhammad ﷺ  , the Messenger of God, ordered Bilal to call out Adhan. Bilal climbed up to the roof of Kaaba, called Adhan and the valley of Makkah rang out with his rich and sonorous takbir. The Prophet then made the seven circuits of the Kaaba, and offered prayer of thanksgiving to his Creator.

### Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   Forgives Quraish

In the meantime, the Quraysh had gathered in the court of the Kaaba awaiting the Prophet. They hoped that he would give them audience before giving a verdict on their fate.

Presently the Prophet appeared at the threshold of the Kaaba. He surveyed the crowd in front of him and addressed it as follows:

> There is no god but Allah. He is One and all Alone, and He has no partners. All praise and thanks to Him. He has fulfilled His promise. He has helped His slave to victory, and He has dispersed the gangs of his enemies.
>
> ‘O people! Listen to me. All the arrogance, the distinctions, the pride, and all the claims of blood of the Times of Ignorance are under my feet today.
> 
> ‘O Quraysh! Allah has destroyed the arrogance of the Times of Ignorance, and He has destroyed the pride of race. All men are the children of Adam, and Adam was a handful of dust.”

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   then read the following verse from Qur’an:

    O People! We created you from a male and a female and distributed you among tribes and families for the facility of reference only. But in the sight of God only those people have a place of honor who are God-fearing and God-loving. Verily, God is knowledgeable and understanding. 
    Chapter 49; verse 13

This verse is the Magna Carta of the equality and brotherhood of all men in Islam. There cannot be any distinction between men on the grounds of race, color, nationality, family or wealth. But whereas Islam destroys all other distinctions, it upholds a distinction of its own, and that is the distinction of faith and character.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   then posed a question to the Quraysh: “How do you think, I am going to treat you now?” They said: “You are a generous brother, and the son of a generous brother. We expect only charity and forgiveness from you.” He said: “I will tell you what Joseph said to his brothers,

    ‘There is no blame on you today.' (Quran, Chapter 12 verse 92)

"Go now; all of you are my freedmen.”

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   declared a general amnesty in Makkah. The amnesty extended even to the apostates. He forbade his army to plunder the city or to seize anything that belonged to the Quraysh. Quraysh had left nothing undone to compass his destruction, and the destruction of Islam; but in his hour of triumph, he condoned all their crimes and transgressions.

The Quraysh, at first, were incredulous. They could not believe their own ears. How could prophet Muhammad ﷺ   resist the temptation to kill them all, after all that they had done to him in more than two decades, and especially now that he had so much power in his hand? The unwillingness of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   to use his power was something that utterly surpassed the comprehension of the polytheists of Makkah. Considerable time passed before the meaning of the intent of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   sank into their minds, and the amnesty began to look possible and real to them.

The aim of prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , the Apostle of Peace, was to capture Makkah without bloodshed, and in this he was successful. It was here that he revealed himself, in the words of Al-Qur’an al-Majid “a mercy for all mankind.”

History cannot furnish an example of such forbearance. Not only the pagans were not exterminated; not only they did not have to pay any penalty for their crimes of the past; they were not even disturbed in the possession of the houses which the Muhajireen had left in Makkah, and which they had occupied.

From the Kaaba, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   went to Mount Safa, and the people of Makkah came to acknowledge him as their sovereign in his dual character – as Messenger of God, and as their temporal ruler. All men gave the pledge of their loyalty to prophet Muhammad ﷺ   by placing their hands on his hand. Next came the turn of women to take the oath of loyalty. But he did not want to touch the hand of any woman who was not his wife. He, therefore, ordered Umar bin al-Khattab to accept the pledge of women on his behalf.

## Battle of Hunayn

</summary>

The conquest of Makkah triggered the mass conversion of the Arabs to Islam in many parts of the country. But there were some tribes living in the east and south-east of Makkah which did not wish to abjure idolatry.

They were alarmed at the rapid progress of Islam, and they thought that if it continued to spread at the same speed, they would soon be surrounded by the Muslims, and would become isolated from other pagan tribes. Their leaders figured that it would be unwise on their part to let the Muslims consolidate their recent gains and become too strong.

They, therefore, decided to act immediately by attacking the Muslims in Makkah and destroying them. The leading tribes among them were the Thaqeef, Hawazin, Banu Sa'ad and Banu Jashm, all fierce warriors, jealous of their independence and proud of their warlike traditions.

They had noted that Makkah had surrendered to prophet Muhammad ﷺ   without striking a blow but they attributed the failure of the Quraysh to resist him, to their effeminacy. As for themselves, they were confident that they were more than a match on the battle-field for the warriors of Islam or any other warriors.

In late January 630, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   received intelligence that Thaqeef and Hawazin had left their home base, and were moving toward Makkah. When these reports were confirmed, he too ordered a general mobilization in the newly-conquered city.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   didn't want Makkah to become a battle-ground. He, therefore, hastily left Makkah on January 26, 630 at the head of 12,000 warriors, to meet the enemy. Out of this force, ten thousand men were from Medina, and the other two thousand were recruits from the newly-converted Makkans.

This new army was the largest force ever assembled in Arabia to that date. As its various formations marched out of the city gate, in full panoply of war, Abu Bakr who was watching, was much impressed, and exclaimed: “We cannot be defeated this time because of lack of numbers.”

But very soon he was proven wrong. Muslims were defeated at the beginning even though they were thrice as numerous as the enemy. Qur’an itself called attention of the Muslims, rather pointedly, that numbers alone were no guarantee that they would be victorious.

Though at first disarrayed at the sudden attack of Hawazin, the Muslim force recollected mainly at the effort of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , and ultimately defeated the Hawazin. The latter was pursued at various directions. After Malik bin 'Awf along with his men took shelter in the fort of Ta'if, the Muslim army besieged it which however yielded no significant result, compelling them to return Medina. Meanwhile, some newly converts from the Hawazin tribe came to prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and made a plea to release their women and children who had been captivated from the battlefield of Hunayn. Their request was granted by the Muslims.

After the Mecca conquest and the victory at the Battle of Hunayn, the supremacy of the Muslims was somewhat established throughout the Arabian peninsula. Various tribes started to send their representatives to express their loyalty to the prophet ﷺ  . In the year 9 AH (630 CE), Zakat – which is the obligatory charity in Islam – was introduced and was accepted by most of the people. A few tribes initially refused to pay it, but gradually accepted.

## Tabuk

</summary>

The Expedition of Tabuk, also known as the Expedition of Usra, was a military expedition that was initiated by the Islamic prophet Muhammad ﷺ   in October 630 CE (AH 9). He led a force of as many as 30,000 north to Tabuk, near the Gulf of Aqaba, in present-day northwestern Saudi Arabia.

> Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   and his forces marched northwards to Tabuk, near the Gulf of Aqaba in October 630 (Rajab AH 9). It was his largest and last military expedition. Ali ibn Abi Talib, who participated in several other expedition, did not participate in the Tabuk expedition upon prophet Muhammad's instructions, as he held command at Medina. After arriving at Tabuk and camping there, Muslim army prepared to face the Byzantine invasion. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   spent twenty days at Tabuk, scouting the area, making alliances with local chiefs. With no sign of the Byzantine army, he decided to return to Medina. Though Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   did not encounter a Byzantine army at Tabuk, according to the Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World, "this show of force demonstrated his intention to challenge the Byzantines for control of the northern part of the caravan route from Mecca to Syria".

The battle of Mootah in which the Muslims were defeated, was fought in September 629. Their defeat was interpreted in many circles as a sign of decline in the power of the new Islamic State. The Arab freebooters must have found it very tempting to attack Medina after this fancied decline. But in the summer of 630, rumors were circulating in Medina that it were not the North Arabian tribes but the Roman troops which were massing at the Syrian frontier for an invasion of Hijaz.

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   decided to take preventive action for the defense of Medina, and ordered his followers to prepare themselves for a long campaign in the north.

It was the month of September, and the weather in Hijaz that year was exceedingly hot. Furthermore, a protracted draught threatened the province with conditions of semi-famine. The response of the Muslims, therefore, to the call-up was very lukewarm. They did not wish to leave their homes at a time like this.

The hypocrites in Medina seized this opportunity to plant disaffection in the minds of the neophytes in Islam. They not only did not take part in the campaign but also tried to dissuadeothers from doing so.

In an attempt to undermine the will and purpose of the Muslims, they began to spread alarmist stories that the antagonists this time were not the poor, ill-equipped, backward and ignorant tribal levies which fought without order and without discipline but the Romans who were the most civilized and the most powerful nation in the world, and who, in effect, would exterminate them (the Muslims).

Nevertheless, many Muslims responded to the appeal of the Prophet, and took up arms to defend the faith. When a head-count was taken, there were found to be 30,000 volunteers. It was the largest force ever assembled in Arabia until then.

The Prophet appointed Ali ibn Abi Talib his viceroy in Medina during his own absence. He selected Ali to be his viceroy for the following reasons:

For the hypocrites there was nothing more disagreeable than to see Ali in authority over them. When the army left Medina, they began to whisper that the Apostle had left Ali in Medina because he wanted to get rid of him.

Ali was mortified to hear that his master had found him a “burden.” He, therefore, immediately went after the army and overtook it at Jorf. The Apostle was surprised to see him but when he (Ali) explained why he came, he (the Apostle) said:

> “These people are liars. I left you in Medina to represent me in my absence. Are you not content to be to me what Aaron was to Moses except that there will not be any prophet after me.”

After a laborious march the army arrived at the Syrian frontier, and halted at a hamlet called Tabuk but the Prophet could find no sign of the Roman army or of any other army or enemy. The frontier was peaceful and quiet. The reports he had heard in Medina about an imminent invasion by the Romans, were false.

Peace and tranquillity on the Syrian frontier is another proof that the Romans considered the battle of Mootah as nothing more than a foray by a band of desert Arabs. If Mootah had been such a titanic battle as some Muslim historians claim it was, the Romans would have maintained their garrisons on the border. But they didn't maintain even pickets much less garrisons!

The Messenger of God then pondered the next step to be taken in Tabuk.

Calling a council of war, he (Mohammed) propounded thequestion whether or not to continue forward (from Tabuk). To this Omar replied drily: “If thou has the command of God to proceed further, do so.” “If I had the command of God to proceed further,” observed Mohammed, “I should not have asked thy counsel.” (The Life of Mohammed)

Eventually, the Prophet decided not to advance into Syria but to return to Medina.

The army spent ten days in Tabuk. Though it had not been engaged in any action, its presence at the frontier had some salutary effects. Many northern tribes of Bedouins accepted Islam. Dauma-tul-Jandal, a strategic post between Medina and Syria, was acquired as new territory.

Just before the army left Tabuk, the monks of the monastery of St. Catherine in the valley of Sinai, came to see the Prophet. He gave them audience, and granted them a charter which is comparable to the Charter of Medina which he had granted to the Jews. Its main terms were:
1. The Muslims would protect the churches and monasteries of the Christians. They would not demolish any church property either to build mosques or to build houses for the Muslims.
2. All ecclesiastical property (of the Christians) would be exempt from every tax.
3. No ecclesiastical authority would ever be forced by the Muslims to abandon his post.
4. No Christian would ever be forced by the Muslims to become a convert to Islam.
5. If a Christian woman marries a Muslim, she would have full freedom to follow her own religion.

The army recuperated from the toil and fatigue of the long journey, and the Prophet gave it the signal to return home. He arrived in Medina after an absence of one month.

### Last Years of The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

# PROOFREADINGPROOFREADINGPROOFREADING

<details><summary>

## The Year of Delegations

</summary>

During the last ten years of his life, the Prophet of Islam had organized eighty expeditions which left Medina on various missions – some warlike and others peaceful. Ali's expedition to Yemen is of especial interest because it was the last of them all. No other expedition left Medina in the lifetime of the Prophet.

The year 10 A.H. (A.D. 631) is called the Year of the Delegations. Many Arab tribes sent delegations to Medina both to accept Islam, and to give Muhammad Mustafa their pledge of allegiance as their temporal sovereign.

In year one of Hijri (A.D. 622) Medina had the status of a city-state but within ten years it had burgeoned into the capital of a “national” state. The whole peninsula had acknowledged its spiritual and temporal authority. Muhammad Mustafa, may God bless him and his house, had established internal peace in the whole country, and had taken effective steps to safeguard the “national” interests of the Muslim umma. There was no threat to the security of the Islamic State from any external aggression.

The Jews and the Christians were paying taxes or tribute (Jizya). They were enjoying all the rights of citizenship of the Islamic State, and they were enjoying full religious freedom. The Arabs, most of them now converted to Islam, were on the eve of a vigorous “national” renaissance. These were only a few of the countless blessings that Islam had brought to the Arabian pennsula.

## 632: Farewell Hajj Pilgrimage

</summary>

This is the only Hajj pilgrimage in which prophet Muhammad ﷺ   participates.

In 631 CE, during the Hajj season, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   appointed Abu Bakr to lead 300 Muslims to the pilgrimage in Mecca. As per old custom, many pagans from other parts of Arabia came to Mecca to perform pilgrimage in pre-Islamic manner. Ali, at the direction of prophet Muhammad ﷺ  , delivered a sermon stipulating the new rites of Hajj and abrogating the pagan rites. He especially declared that no unbeliever, pagan, and naked man would be allowed to circumambulate the Kaaba from the next year. After this declaration was made, a vast number of people of Bahrain, Yemen, and Yamama, who included both the pagans and the people of the book, gradually embraced Islam. 

Next year, In 632 CE, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   performed hajj and taught Muslims first-hand the various rites of Hajj. On the 9th of Dhu al-Hijjah, from Mount Arafat, he delivered his Farewell Sermon in which he abolished old blood feuds and disputes based on the former tribal system, repudiated racial discrimination, and advised people to "be good to women". According to Sunni tafsir, the following Quranic verse was delivered during this event: "Today I have perfected your religion, and completed my favours for you and chosen Islam as a religion for you" (Quran 5:3).

In dhul-qidah, (the 11th month of the islamic calendar) of the year 10 A.H., Muhammad Mustafa, the Messenger of God, announced that he would visit Makkah to perform Hajj. The news spread in the country and an immense number of Muslims gathered in Medina to accompany him to Makkah. Their numbers are estimated at more than 100,000.

Before his departure, he appointed Abu Dujana Ansari as governor of Medina during his own absence. On the 25th of Dhul-Qidah, he left Medina, accompanied by all his wives.

The Muslims observed every move, every act, and every gesture of the Prophet on this occasion, and everything that he did, became a precedent for all time, to be imitated by all Muslims.

After the fall of Mecca, Muhammad performed (for the second time since his Emigration) the rite of the Umra, the ritual processions around the Kaaba, and the journeys between Safa and Marwa (400 yards apart). But he had not participated in the Hajj...He may have had some idea of depaganizing the Hajj.

After the capture of Mecca, in the following Dhu'l-Hijja, Attab, the governor whom Muhammad had installed in Mecca, conducted the ceremony; both Muslims and pagans took part.

The following year, Dhu'l-Hijja of the year 9 (March-April 631), Muhammad still hung back from joining the Hajj. He had not yet finalized his teaching on every detail of the pilgrimage and was unwilling to perform the rites in company with pagans. He sent Abu Bakr to preside over the ceremonies. He was overtaken on the way by Ali, who was the bearer of a brand new revelation from on high which it was his business to see implemented.

Pagans generally were to take no further part in the pilgrimage. On the expiry of the sacred truce of four months, all who had not been converted or made a special agreement with Muhammad, would be dealt with as enemies. This was the last year that pagans were permitted to join the Hajj.

One year later, in Dhu'l-Hajj of the year 10 (March 632), the Prophet announced that he would personally conduct the ceremony, now that the temple and shrines were purified of all pagan presence. He reached Mecca on 5 Dhu'l-Hajj (3rd March). On 8 Dhu'l-Hijja, the ceremonies began. All eyes were fixed on the Prophet because his behavior during the rites would become law.

### Farewell Speech

This sermon was delivered on the Ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah, 10 A.H. ( 623AD) in the Uranah valley of Mount Arafat in Mecca. It was the occasion of annual rites of Haj. It is also known as the Farewell Pilgrimage.
 
After praising and thanking Allah the Prophet (p.b.u.h.) began with the words:
 
> "O People! Lend me an attentive ear, for I know not whether after this year I shall ever be amongst you again. Therefore, listen carefully to what I am saying and take these words to those who could not be present here today."
>
> "O People! just as you regard this month, this day ,this city as sacred ,so regard the life and property of every Muslim a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your Lord, and that he will indeed reckon your deeds."
>
> "Allah has forbidden you to take usury, therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequality. Allah has judged that there shall be no interest and that all interest due to Abbas Ibn 'Aal-Muttalib be waived."
> 
> "Every right arising out of homicide in pre-Islamic days is henceforth waived and the first such right that I waive is that arising from the murder of Rabiah ibni al-Harithiah."
>
> "O men! the unbelievers indulge in tampering with the calendar in order to make permissible that which Allah forbade, and to prohibit what Allah has made permissible. With Allah the months are twelve in number. Four of them are holy, there are sucessive and one occurs singly between the months of Jumada and Shaban."
>
> "Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will be able to lead you astray in big things so beware of following him in small things."
> 
> "O People it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well never to be unchaste."
>
> "O People! listen to me in earnest, worship Allah, say your five daily prayers, fast during month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford it."
>
> "All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a White has no superiority over a Black nor a Black has any superiority over a White except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly."
>
> "Do not therefore do injustice to yourselves. Remember one day you will meet Allah and answer your deeds. So beware, do not astray from the path of righteousness after I am gone."
>
> "O People! No Prophet or apostle will come after me and no new faith will be born. Reason well, therefore O People! and understand words that I convey to you. I leave behind me two things, the Quran and the Sunnah and if you follow these you will never go astray."
>
> "All those who listen to me shall pass on my words to others and those to others again; and may the last ones understand my words better than those who listen to me directly."
>
> "O Allah, be my witness, that I have conveyed your message to Your people."
> 
As part of this sermon, the prophet recited to them a revelation from Allah, which he had just received, and which completed the Quran, for it was the last passage to be revealed:

    This day the disbeliever's despair of prevailing against your religion, so fear them not, but fear Me (Allah)! This day have I perfected for you, your religion and fulfilled My favor unto you, and it hath been My good pleasure to choose Islam for you as your religion. 
    Quran, Surah 5, Ayah 3

> The sermon was repeated sentence by sentence by Safwan's brother Rabiah (RA), who had powerful voice, at the request of the Prophet and he faithfully, proclaimed to over ten thousand gathered on the occasion. Towards the end of his sermon, the Prophet asked "O people, have I faithfully delivered unto you my message?" A powerful murmur of assents "O Allah! yes!" arose from thousands of pilgrims and the vibrant words "Allahumma Na'm," rolled like thunder throughout the valley. 

The Prophet raised his forefinger and said: `"O Allah bear witness that I have conveyed your message to your people."`

## 632: Death of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

</summary>

Soon after his return from the pilgrimage, prophet Muhammad ﷺ   fell ill and suffered for several days with fever, head pain, and                         dweakness. He was confined to bed by Abu Bakr. During his illness, he appointed Abu Bakr to lead the prayers in the mosque. He ordered to donate the last remaining coins in his house as charity. He died on June 8 632, in Medina, at the age of 62 or 63, in the house of his wife Aisha.

The health of the Prophet grew worse. His last days were remarkable for the calmness and serenity of his mind. He was able, though weak and feeble, to lead the public prayers until within three days of his death. He requested that he might be permitted to stay at Aisha's house close to the mosque during his illness, an arrangement to which his other wives assented. As long as his strength lasted, he took part in the public prayers. The last time he appeared in the mosque he addressed the congregation, after the usual prayers were over, in the following words: "0 Muslims, if I have wronged anyone of you, here I am to answer for it; if I owe anything to anyone, all I may happen to possess belongs to you." A man in the crowd rose and claimed three dirhams which he had given to a poor man at the request of the Prophet. They were immediately paid back with these words: "Better to blush in this world than in the next."

The Prophet then prayed and implored Allah's mercy for those who had fallen in the persecution of their enemies. He recommended to all his followers the observance of religious duties and the leading of a life of peace and goodwill. Then he spoke with emotion and with a voice still so powerful as to reach beyond the outer doors of the mosque: "By the Lord in Whose hand lies the soul of Muhammad as to myself, no man can lay hold on me in any matter; I have not made lawful anything excepting what Allah has made lawful; nor have I prohibited anything but that which Allah in His Book has prohibited."

Then turning to the women who sat close by, he exclaimed: "0 Fatimah, my daughter, and Safia, my aunt, work you both that which will procure your acceptance with the Lord, for verily I have no power to save you in any wise." He then rose and re-entered the house of Aisha.

Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:

> Aisha, (complaining of headache) said, "Oh, my head"! Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "If it happens while I am still living (i.e. if you pass away during my lifetime) then I would ask Allah's Forgiveness for you and pray for you." Aisha said, "Wa thuklayah! By Allah, I think you want me to die; and If this should happen, you would spend the last part of the day as a groom with one of your wives!" The Prophetﷺ   said, "Nay, I should say, 'Oh my head!' I felt like sending someone to call Abu Bakr and his son, and appoint him as my successor lest some people claimed something or some others wished something, but then I said (to myself), 'Allah would not allow it to be otherwise, and the Muslims would prevent it to be otherwise"."

### False Prophets

A force was now being prepared under Usama, Ibn Zaid, whose father was killed at Muta, against the Byzantines, to exact the long-delayed reparation for the murder of the envoy to Syria. However, the news of the Prophet's sickness and failing health caused that expedition to be stopped. This news was soon noised abroad and produced disorder in some districts. Three pretenders had arisen who gave themselves out as prophets and tried by all kinds of imposture to win over their tribes. The most dangerous of these pretenders was known as Al Aswad. He was a chief of Yemen and a man of great wealth and sagacity, as well as a clever conjurer. He soon succeeded in gaining over his tribesmen and, with their help, reduced to subjection many of the neighboring towns. He killed Shahr, whom the Prophet had appointed as Governor of Sana in the place of his father Bazan, who had just died. Bazan had been the viceroy of Yemen under Chosroes of Persia; after he had adopted Islam he was allowed by the Prophet to remain as Governor of Yemen. He was able to convert to Islam all the Persian colony in that province. Al-Aswad, the conjurer, had now killed Shahr, but soon after he was massacred by the Persians of Yemen.

The other two pretenders, Tulayha and Haroun by name, were not suppressed until after the death of the Prophet, during the reign of Abu Bakr. Haroun, better known as Mussaylamah, addressed to the Prophet a letter which ran as follows: "From Mussaylamah the Prophet of Allah, to Muhammad the Prophet of Allah. Peace be to you. I am your partner. Let the exercise of authority be divided between us. Half the earth will be mine, and half will belong to your Quraish. But the Quraish are too greedy to be satisfied with a just division." To this letter the Prophet replied as follows: "From Muhammad the Messenger of Allah, to Mussaylamah the liar. Peace be to those who follow the right path. The earth belongs to Allah. It is He Who makes to reign whomsoever He pleases. Only those will prosper who fear the Lord."

### Burial of the Prophet

Al-Abbas, the Prophet's uncle, presided at the preparation for the burial, and the body was duly washed and perfumed.

There was some dispute between the Quraish and the Ansars as to the place of burial; however, Abu Bakr settled the dispute by affirming that he had heard the Prophet say that a prophet should be buried at the very spot where he died. A grave was accordingly dug in the ground within the house of Aisha and under the bed on which the Prophet died. In this grave the body was buried, and the usual rites were performed by those who were present.

Thus ended the glorious life of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon him.

    as a witness and a bringer ofglad tidings, a warner and a summoner unto Allah by His permission, and a lamp that gives light 
    Qur'an, 33:45-46
 
    the one who was sent as a mercy and blessing to mankind 
    Qur'an, 21:10
 
He left the temporal world, but the message he brought to mankind is eternal.
 
    Now has come unto you light from Allah and a clear book whereby Allah guides him who seeks His pleasure unto the paths ofpeace. He brings them out of the darkness into the light by His decree and guides them unto a straight path.
    Qur'an, 5:16
 
    A Book which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad!) so that you may thereby bring forth mankind from darkness unto the light, by the permission of their Lord, unto the path of Him, the Exalted in power, the One worthy of all praise. 
    Qur'an, 14:2

    O people! There has come to you an admonition from your Lord which is a healing for what is in the breasts, and a guidance and mercy for the believers. 
    Qur'an, 10:57
 
    Accept what the Messenger gives you and stay away from whatever he forbids you. 
    Qur'an, 59:7

### Speech of Abu Bakr 

A few hours after he returned from the mosque, the Prophet died while laying his head on the bosom of Aisha. As soon as the Prophet's death was announced, a crowd of people gathered at the door of the house of Aisha, exclaiming: "How can our messenger be dead?" Umar said: "No, he is not dead; he will be restored to us, and those are traitors to the cause of Islam who say he is dead. If they say so let them be cut in pieces."

But Abu Bakr entered the house at this moment, and after he had touched the body of the Prophet with a demonstration of profound affection, he appeared at the door and addressed the crowd with the following speech:

When Prophet Muhammad passed away the Muslims were devastated, some even refused to accept that the Prophet had died. Their hearts were broken. 

Although overwhelmed by grief, Abu Bakr addressed the people, he praised and glorified God and said, “Whoever worshipped Muhammad should know that Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped God, then God is Ever-living and shall never die.” He then recited verses from the Qur’an.

    "(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die."
    Qur’an 39:30

    "Muhammad is no more than a Messenger, and indeed (many) Messengers have passed away before him. If he dies or is killed, will you then turn back on your heels (as disbelievers)? And he who turns back on his heels, not the least harm will he do to God, and God will give reward to those who are grateful." 
    Qur’an 3:144

During this great crisis, the devastated Muslims chose Abu Bakr as their leader.

## 632-634: Abu Bakr

</summary>

After Prophet Muhammad ﷺ   dies, Abu Bakr is elected as his khalifah (representative).

Abu Bakr (أبو بكر,, 573 – 23 August 634) was the founder and first caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate ruling from June 632 until his death. He was the most prominent companion, closest advisor and a father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad ﷺ  (c. 570–632).

Abu Bakr was born in 573 CE to Abu Quhafa and Umm Khayr. He belonged to the tribe of Banu Taym. In the Age of Ignorance, he was a monotheist and condemned idol-worshipping. As a wealthy trader, Abu Bakr used to free slaves. Following his conversion to Islam in 610, Abu Bakr served as a close aide to Muhammad, who bestowed on him the title al-Siddiq ('the Truthful'). The former took part in almost all battles under the Islamic prophet. He extensively contributed his wealth in support of Muhammad's work and also accompanied Muhammad, on his migration to Medina. By the invitations of Abu Bakr, many prominent Sahabis became Muslims. He remained the closest advisor to Muhammad, being present at almost all his military conflicts. In the absence of Muhammad, Abu Bakr led the prayers and expeditions.

After Muhammad's death in 632, Abu Bakr succeeded the leadership of the Muslim community as the caliph. His election was opposed by a large number of rebellious tribal leaders, who had apostatized from Islam. Abu Bakr's commanders kept the rebels in check and subsequently defeated them in the Ridda Wars, as a result of which he was able to consolidate and expand the rule of the nascent caliphate over the entire Arabia. Abu Bakr ordered the initial incursions into the neighboring Byzantium and Sasanian Empire, initiating the Muslim conquests of Levant and Persia respectively. Apart from politics, Abu Bakr is also credited for the compilation of the Quran, of which he had a personal caliphal codex. Abu Bakr nominated his principal adviser Umar (r. 634–644) as his successor before dying in August 634. Along with Muhammad, Abu Bakr is buried in the Green Dome at the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi in Medina, the second holiest site in Islam.

Though the period of his caliphate was short, it included successful invasions of the two most powerful empires of the time, a remarkable achievement in its own right. He set in motion a historical trajectory that in a few decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history. His victory over the local rebel Arab forces is a significant part of Islamic history. Abu Bakr is widely honored among Muslims.

Abu Bakr is amongst the only few companions of Muhammad to be referred to in the Quran, being called the al-Sahib ('the Companion') of Muhammad in the ninth chapter at-Tawba. In this same verse, Abu Bakr is also mentioned as the Second of the Two (thānīya ithnayn), which later became an honorific for the caliph. These two verses are related to Abu Bakr's three-day refuge with Muhammad in the Cave of Thawr, an event for which Abu Bakr received the Persian epithet yār-i-ghār meaning the "Friend of the Cave". 

The Sunni Muslims consider Abu Bakr a 'rightly-guided' (rashid) and the most superior caliph. Abu Bakr is also believed to be the 'Greatest of the Truthful' (Siddīq Akbar), a rank which comes after the prophets. Purported hadiths related about Abu Bakr include Muhammad's testifying of Abu Bakr for paradise. Moreover, Muhammad appointing Abu Bakr to lead the prayers during his last days is associated to justify Abu Bakr's later ascension to the caliphate as they display the regard with which Muhammad held the former. Abu Bakr is regarded among the best of Muhammad's followers. Muhammad reportedly said: "If the faith of Abu Bakr was weighed against the faith of the people of the earth, the faith of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others." Abu Bakr used to solve disputes by looking at the Quran and Sunnah. He was also the most knowledgeable Sahabi regarding the genealogy of Arabs.

Abu Bakr's first address as caliph:

    I have been given the authority over you, and I am not the best of you. If I do well, help me; and if I do wrong, set me right. Sincere regard for truth is loyalty and disregard for truth is treachery. The weak amongst you shall be strong with me until I have secured his rights, if God wills; and the strong amongst you shall be weak with me until I have wrested from him the rights of others, if God wills. Obey me so long as I obey God and His Messenger. But if I disobey God and His Messenger, you owe me no obedience. Arise for your prayer, God have mercy upon you.

### Riddah Wars

> The wars of riddah against tribes who secede from the confederacy. Abu Bakr manages to subdue the revolt and unite the tribes of Arabia.

The wars against apostasy were fought for the cause of the poor and to restore their right to benefit from Zakat that was made compulsory by God on the wealth of the rich, and these wars took place when some people tried to rob the poor of their rights.  

After the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), some Arab tribes declined to pay Zakat by saying: “We used to give Zakat to Muhammad. But now Muhammad is no more, and hence we are not obliged to give Zakat.” Some of them renounced Islam while others did not but refused to pay Zakat. Some senior companions of the Prophet (pbuh), including Umar Bin Khattab, were against being tough on this matter so as not to cause Islamic society to disintegrate and lose its strength. But the Caliph Abu Bakr was firm and tough on this issue. He considered those who refused to pay Zakat as apostates, and in this respect, there was a famous saying of Abu Bakr: “By Allah, if they withhold the rope of a camel they used to give in Zakat to Allah’s Messenger, I will fight them for it.”

Abu Bakr mobilized armies to fight apostates and those who refused to pay Zakat, in addition to those who made undue claims to prophethood like Musailama, the liar, of Yamama. This man arrived in Madinah and embraced Islam during the period of the Prophet (pbuh). After returning to his people of Bani Hanifa, he told them: “I had reached agreement with Muhammad to divide the prophethood between me and him.” Musailama informed his people that he had annulled the obligatory prayer, permitted adultery, and the drinking of liquor. He also sent a message to the Prophet (pbuh) in which he said: “From Musailama, the messenger of Allah to Muhammad, the messenger of Allah: I share the authority with you now: you have half of the earth and it is for me the remaining half. But the Quraish are oppressors.”  

The Prophet (pbuh) sent a reply message saying: “From Muhammad, the messenger of Allah, to Musailama, the liar. Peace be upon those who followed the righteous path. After all, the earth belongs to Allah. He gives this to be inherited by those whom He wishes from among His subjects, and the ultimate reward is for those who are pious.”

Musailama was one of the apostates with whom Abu Bakr decided to fight.

Accordingly, he mobilized an army under the command of Khaled Bin Al-Waleed who was able to kill Musailama and return his people to Islam by encouraging them to observe the pillars of Islam, including the payment of Zakat.

As we know, Zakat is the third pillar of Islam. The Qur’an mentions it on several occasions together with performing obligatory prayer. A Hadith, reported by Ibn Umar from the Prophet (pbuh), says: “I was ordered to fight the people until they say there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, as well as to perform prayer and give Zakat.” – Bukhari and Muslim.   

## Preservation of The Quran

> Umar and Abu Bakr told Zayd to compile and write The Quran because many khafiz died in one of the battles of riddah.

Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the Quran in written form. After the Battle of Yamama in 632, numerous memorizers of the Quran had been killed. Fearing that the Quran may become lost or corrupted, Umar requested that Abu Bakr authorize the compilation and preservation of the scriptures in written format. The caliph was initially hesitant, being quoted as saying, "How can we do that which the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless and keep him, did not himself do?" He eventually relented, however, and appointed Zayd ibn Thabit, who had previously served as one of the scribes of Muhammad, for the task of gathering the scattered verses. 

The fragments were recovered from every quarter, including from the ribs of palm branches, scraps of leather, stone tablets and "from the hearts of men". The collected work was transcribed onto sheets and compiled in the sequence that had been instructed by Muhammad, as opposed to the order in which they had been revealed. The complete work was then verified through comparison with Quran memorisers. 

The finished codex, termed the Mus'haf, was presented to Abu Bakr, who prior to his death, bequeathed it to his successor Umar. Upon Umar's own death, the Mus'haf was left to his daughter Hafsa, who had been one of the wives of Muhammad. It was this volume, borrowed from Hafsa, which formed the basis of Uthman's legendary prototype, which became the definitive text of the Quran. All later editions are derived from this original.

Abu Bakr appointed Umar as his successor before dying in 634 CE. Due to his strict and autocratic nature, Umar was not a very popular figure among the notables of Medina and members of Majlis al Shura; accordingly, high-ranking companions of Abu Bakr attempted to discourage him from naming Umar. Nevertheless, Abu Bakr decided to make Umar his successor. Umar was well known for his extraordinary willpower, intelligence, political astuteness, impartiality, justice, and care for the poor. Abu Bakr is reported to have said to the high-ranking advisers:

His (Umar's) strictness was there because of my softness when the weight of Caliphate will be over his shoulders he will remain no longer strict. If I will be asked by God to whom I have appointed my successor, I will tell him that I have appointed the best man among your men.

Abu Bakr was aware of Umar's power and ability to succeed him. His was perhaps one of the smoothest transitions of power from one authority to another in the Muslim lands. Before his death, Abu Bakr called Uthman to write his will in which he declared Umar his successor. In his will he instructed Umar to continue the conquests on Iraqi and Syrian fronts.

### Death of Abu Bakr

Abu Bakr developed high fever, and was confined to bed. His illness prolonged, and when his condition worsened, he felt that his end was near. Some companions called on him to inquire about his welfare. They said, "O Vicegerent of the Apostle of God, may we call a physician to examine you". He said that the physician had already visited him. They inquired as to what had the physician said. Abu Bakr said that the physician had said that he would do what he would do.

Refund of the amount drawn from the treasury. When Abu Bakr felt that his end was near, he wanted to know what amount he had drawn from the State treasury as allowance for the office of the Caliph. He was told that this amount was six thousand dirhams. He directed that the plot of land which belonged to him should be sold, and from the sale proceeds, the amount of six thousand dirhams should be paid to the State treasury. He next took stock of the personal fortune that he had acquired since becoming the Caliph. These assets included a slave, a camel, and some cloth. He directed that these assets should be handed over to the new Caliph. When in pursuance of the will of Abu Bakr, the amount of six thousand dirhams and other assets were handed over to the new Caliph, Umar, the new Caliph wept and said, "O Abu Bakr, may God bless you; you have made the task of your successor most difficult."

Property bequeathed to Ayesha. Abu Bakr had bequeathed some property to Ayesha. Now that he was on deathbed he desired that the property should be divided among her two brothers and three sisters in accordance with the Islamic Law. Ayesha said that they were two sisters, Asma and herself, and inquired as to who was the third sister? Abu Bakr said that his wife Habiba was pregnant, and he had a feeling that the child would be a girl. Indeed after the death of Abu Bakr, a girl was born to Habiba, who was named Umm Kulthum. Ayesha complied with the wish of her father and released the property in her charge for distribution among her brothers and sisters.

The Coffin. Abu Bakr next asked Ayesha as to how many pieces of cloth were used for the coffin of the Holy Prophet. Ayesha said that three pieces had been used in the coffin of the Holy Prophet. Abu Bakr thereupon desired that for his coffin as well, three pieces should be used. He wanted that the two sheets that he was wearing should be washed and used for his coffin, while the third piece might be purchased. Ayesha said that they were not so poor as not to afford to purchase all the three pieces required for the coffin. Abu Bakr said, "No, the new material will be of more use to the living than the dead. The cloth for the dead body is merely meant to absorb blood and pus, and it is not necessary that the cloth should be new."

The day of death. Abu Bakr inquired of Ayesha as to what was the day on which the Holy Prophet had died. She replied that the day was Monday. Abu Bakr next inquired as to what was the day that day. She said that it was Monday. Abu Bakr said that in that case he would die that day. He desired that if he died that day, he should be buried the same day.

Last moments of Abu Bakr. As Abu Bakr lay on the deathbed, Ayesha wailed: "And one so unsullied in honor that the cloud draws moisture from his face; the protection of orphans. the defense of widows." Abu Bakr said, "No, this encomium must be reserved for the Holy Prophet alone". Ayesha said: "Wealth is of no avail to a man; on the day when the death-rattle is in his throat, and his breast is contracted by it." Abu Bakr uncovered his face and said, "It is not so, Say that the agony of death shall come in truth; this, O man, is what you sought to avoid." He swooned, and on regaining consciousness, he recited: "The companionship of the most high. The companionship of the most high."

> O Allah, forgive me and have mercy upon me, and join me with the highest companions (in Paradise).

With these words of the Holy Quran on his lips, Abu Bakr expired. From God he had come and to God he returned. It was 22nd of Jamadi-ul-Akhir of 13 A.H. corresponding to 23rd of August, 534 C.E. The day was Monday. His death took place between the hours of the Maghrib and Isha prayers. He was 63 years at the time of his death. That was the exact age at which the Holy Prophet had died.

Burial. According to the will of Abu Bakr, his dead body was prepared for burial by his wife Asma b Umas. She was helped by his son Abdul Rahman. The funeral prayer was led by Umar. He was buried the same night in the house of Ayesha by the side of the grave of the Holy Prophet. In life, Abu Bakr had the honor of being a bosom companion of the Holy Prophet, after death he had also the honor of resting by the side of the Master.

## 634-644: Umar ibn Al-Khattab

</summary>

During the khaliphate of Umar: 
* The Muslim armies conquer Iraq, Syria and Egypt.
* 638 Muslims conquer Jerusalem, which becomes the third holiest city in the Islamic world after Mecca and Medina.
* 641 Muslims control Syria, Palestine and Egypt. They have defeated the Persian Empire. The garrison towns of Kufah, Basrah, Fustat are built to house the Muslim troops.
* 644 Khalif Umar is assassinated by a Persian prisoner of war. Uthman ibn Affan is elected the third caliph.

Umar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb (عمر بن الخطاب, also spelled Omar, c. 583/584 – 644) was the second Rashidun caliph, ruling from August 634 until his assassination in 644. He succeeded Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) as the second caliph of the Rashidun Caliphate on 23 August 634. Umar was a senior companion and father-in-law of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He was also an expert Muslim jurist known for his pious and just nature.

Umar initially opposed Muhammad, his distant Qurayshite kinsman and later son-in-law. Following his conversion to Islam in 616, he became the first Muslim to openly pray at the Kaaba. Umar participated in almost all battles and expeditions under Muhammad, who bestowed the title al-Faruq ('the one who distinguishes (between right and wrong') upon Umar, for his judgements. After Muhammad's death in June 632, Umar pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) as the first caliph and served as the closest adviser to the latter until August 634, when the dying Abu Bakr nominated Umar as his successor.

Under Umar, the caliphate expanded at an unprecedented rate, ruling the Sasanian Empire and more than two-thirds of the Byzantine Empire. His attacks against the Sasanian Empire resulted in the conquest of Persia in less than two years (642–644). According to Jewish tradition, Umar set aside the Christian ban on Jews and allowed them into Jerusalem and to worship. Umar was assassinated by the Persian slave Abu Lu'lu'a Firuz in 644.

Umar is generally viewed by historians to be one of the most powerful and influential Muslim caliphs in history. He is revered in the Sunni Islamic tradition as a great just ruler and paragon of Islamic virtues, and some hadiths identify him as the second greatest of the Sahabah after Abu Bakr.

### Initial challenges

Even though almost all of the Muslims had given their pledge of loyalty to Umar, he was feared more than loved. According to Muhammad Husayn Haykal, the first challenge for Umar was to win over his subjects and the members of Majlis al Shura.

Umar was a gifted orator, and he used his ability to improve his reputation among the people.

Muhammad Husayn Haykal wrote that Umar's stress was on the well-being of the poor and underprivileged. In addition to this, Umar, in order to improve his reputation and relation with the Banu Hashim, the tribe of Ali, delivered to the latter his disputed estates in Khaybar. He followed Abu Bakr's decision over the disputed land of Fidak, continuing to treat it as state property. In the Ridda wars, thousands of prisoners from rebel and apostate tribes were taken away as slaves during the expeditions. Umar ordered a general amnesty for the prisoners, and their immediate emancipation. This made Umar quite popular among the Bedouin tribes. With the necessary public support on his side, Umar took the bold decision of recalling Khalid ibn Walid from supreme command on the Roman front.

### Political and Civil Administration

The government of Umar was a unitary government, where the sovereign political authority was the caliph. The empire of Umar was divided into provinces and some autonomous territories, e.g., Azerbaijan and Armenia, that had accepted the suzerainty of the caliphate. The provinces were administered by the provincial governors or Wali, personally and fastidiously selected by Umar. Provinces were further divided into about 100 districts. Each district or main city was under the charge of a junior governor or Amir, usually appointed by Umar himself, but occasionally also appointed by the provincial governor. Other officers at the provincial level were:
* Katib, the Chief Secretary
* Katib-ud-Diwan, the Military Secretary
* Sahib-ul-Kharaj, the Revenue Collector
* Sahib-ul-Ahdath, the Police chief
* Sahib-Bait-ul-Mal, the Treasury Officer
* Qadi, the Chief Judge

In some districts, there were separate military officers, though the Wali was, in most cases, the Commander-in-chief of the army quartered in the province.

Every appointment was made in writing. At the time of appointment an instrument of instructions was issued with a view to regulating the Wali's conduct. On assuming office, the Wali was required to assemble the people in the main mosque, and read the instrument of instructions before them.

Umar's general instructions to his officers were:

> Remember, I have not appointed you as commanders and tyrants over the people. I have sent you as leaders instead, so that the people may follow your example. Give the Muslims their rights and do not beat them lest they become abused. Do not praise them unduly, lest they fall into the error of conceit. Do not keep your doors shut in their faces, lest the more powerful of them eat up the weaker ones. And do not behave as if you were superior to them, for that is tyranny over them.

Various other strict codes of conduct were to be obeyed by the governors and state officials. The principal officers were required to travel to Mecca on the occasion of the Hajj, during which people were free to present any complaint against them. In order to minimize the chances of corruption, Umar made it a point to pay high salaries to the staff. Provincial governors received as much as five to seven thousand dirham annually besides their shares of the spoils of war (if they were also the commander in chief of the army of their sector). Under Umar, the empire was divided into the following provinces:
* Mecca (Arabia)
* Medina (Arabia)
* Basra (Iraq)
* Kufa (Iraq)
* Jazira, in the upper reaches of the Tigris and Euphrates
* Syria
* Iliyā' (Palestine)
* Ramlah (Palestine)
* Upper Egypt
* Lower Egypt
* Khorasan (Persia)
* Azerbaijan (Persia)
* Fars (Persia)

Umar was first to establish a special department for the investigation of complaints against the officers of the State. This department acted as the Administrative court, where the legal proceedings were personally led by Umar. The department was under the charge of Muhammad ibn Maslamah, one of Umar's most trusted men. In important cases, Muhammad ibn Maslamah was deputed by Umar to proceed to the spot, investigate the charge and take action. Sometimes an Inquiry Commission was constituted to investigate the charge. On occasion, the officers against whom complaints were received were summoned to Medina, and charged in Umar's administrative court. Umar was known for this intelligence service through which he made his officials accountable. This service was also said to have inspired fear in his subjects.

Umar was a pioneer in some affairs:

* Umar was the first to introduce the public ministry system, where the records of officials and soldiers were kept. He also kept a record system for messages he sent to Governors and heads of state.
* He was the first to appoint police forces to keep civil order.
* He was the first to discipline the people when they became disordered.
* Another important aspect of Umar's rule was that he forbade any of his governors and agents from engaging in any sort of business dealings whilst in a position of power. An agent of Umar by the name of Al Harith ibn K'ab ibn Wahb was once found to have extra money beyond his salary and Umar enquired about his wealth. Al Harith replied that he had some money and he engaged in trade with it. Umar said: By Allah, we did not send you to engage in trade! and he took from him the profits he had made.

### Canals

Since Medina, with a rapidly growing population, was at risk of recurring famines when crops were lacking, Umar sought to facilitate the import of grain. He ordered the building of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea and an improvement of port infrastructure on the Arabian coast. When Basra was established during Umar's rule, he started building a nine-mile canal from the Tigris to the new city for irrigation and drinking water. 

Al-Tabari reports that Utba ibn Ghazwan built the first canal from the Tigris River to the site of Basra when the city was in the planning stage. After the city was built, Umar appointed Abu Musa Ashaari (17-29/638 – 650) as its first governor. He began building two important canals, the al-Ubulla and the Ma'qil, linking Basra with the Tigris River. These two canals were the basis for the agricultural development for the whole Basra region and used for drinking water. Umar also adopted a policy of assigning barren lands to those who undertook to cultivate them. This policy continued during the Umayyad period and resulted in the cultivation of large areas of barren lands through the construction of irrigation canals by the state and by individuals.

### Reforms

Under Umar's leadership, the empire expanded; accordingly, he began to build a political structure that would hold together the vast territory. He undertook many administrative reforms and closely oversaw public policy, establishing an advanced administration for the newly conquered lands, including several new ministries and bureaucracies, and ordered a census of all the Muslim territories. During his rule, the garrison cities (amsar) of Basra and Kufa were founded or expanded. In 638, he extended and renovated the Masjid al-Haram (Grand Mosque) in Mecca and al-Masjid al-Nabawi (Mosque of the Prophet) in Medina.

Umar also ordered the expulsion to Syria and Iraq of the Christian and Jewish communities of Najran and Khaybar. He also permitted Jewish families to resettle in Jerusalem, which had previously been barred from all Jews. He issued orders that these Christians and Jews should be treated well and allotted them the equivalent amount of land in their new settlements. Umar also forbade non-Muslims from residing in the Hejaz for longer than three days. He was first to establish the army as a state department.

Umar was founder of Fiqh, or Islamic jurisprudence. He is regarded by Sunni Muslims as one of the greatest Faqih, and, as such, he started the process of codifying Islamic Law.

In 641, he established Bayt al-mal, a financial institution and started annual allowances for the Muslims. As a leader, Umar was known for his simple, austere lifestyle. Rather than adopt the pomp and display affected by the rulers of the time, he continued to live much as he had when Muslims were poor and persecuted. 

### Establishment of Islamic Calendar

In 638, the fourth year of Umar as caliph and the seventeenth year since the Hijra, he decreed that the Islamic calendar should be counted from the year of the Hijra of prophet Muhammad ﷺ   from Mecca to Medina.

### Visit to Jerusalem in 637 CE

During the period of the Second Caliph Umar Ibn al-Khattab, the Muslim forces, under the command of Abu Ubaydah, lay siege to Jerusalem. The Patriarch of the city, Sophronius, stated that he would negotiate only with Caliph Umar and that nobody enters Jerusalem before Caliph Umar. On hearing this Caliph Umar informed that he was on his way.

Accompanied by a servant, Caliph Umar rode on camelback to Jerusalem though he could have been accompanied by an entourage that could have made the ground tremble under the hooves of horses. He did so to show simplicity and ensure that Allah alone deserves all the glories.

On reaching Jerusalem, it was the servant’s turn to ride the camel and as a mark of respect and to ensure that the people see Caliph Umar, he wanted the Caliph to ride the camel. However Caliph Umar refused and entered Jerusalem on foot while the servant rode the camel to the shock and surprise of everyone including Patriarch Sophronius. On reaching the place Caliph Umar continued the journey on foot carrying his shoes in hand under the astonished gaze of the people.

The Muslims who saw this spectacle recited the short prayers that refer to Allah’s absolute greatness and uniqueness. Caliph Umar walked to the army wearing modest threadbare clothes. The Christians who watched everything from the walls of Jerusalem were amazed at the strange simplicity, unable to believe that this simple man could be the leader of those well equipped armies.

Abu Ubaidah who could not contain himself on seeing this unprecedented show of humility rushed to Umar’s side saying” today you have performed a magnificent deed before the people, perhaps you might….? Umar slapped him on the chest and criticized him saying “I wish someone other than you, Abu Ubaydah, had said this. We were a humiliated people and Allah honored us with Islam. We were weak and He gave us strength”.

The Patriarch who saw the unfolding scenes with great admiration said to his people that nobody in the world would be able to stand up to these people and advised them to surrender to be saved. Negotiation took place and a famous treaty called 'Umariyya Covenant” was concluded. This treaty is still preserved in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem.

The Christians requested that Jews, who were not there before the conquest, be forbidden to enter Jerusalem and Umar accepted. Yet on his part Umar offered members of all faiths safety in Jerusalem and protection for their beliefs and their holy places, forbidding them to be desecrated or destroyed.

After the treaty was signed the key to the city was formally handed over in 637 AC. The gates of Jerusalem were opened and Caliph Umar entered along a promenade that led him to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Caliph Umar was inside and the Patriarch said to him “pray”. However Caliph Umar declined, fearing it might establish a precedent that would threaten the church's continued use as a Christian house of worship. Instead he prayed in an area to the south of the church, now the site of the Mosque of Umar in Jerusalem.

In doing so Caliph Umar showed the world the meaning of tolerance and generosity in victory and strength. It was the greatness of Islam that shone in his spirit and was reflected in his ethics though he was a person known for his firmness and courage.  
Caliph Umar then asked to be taken to the site of Masjid Al Aqsa. He could not find, but patriarch showed him the way.

On arrival, accompanied by hundreds of Muslims, he found the area covered in dust and debris. He rolled up his sleeves and began sweeping and clearing the mosque immediately. On seeing this other Muslims including army generals and soldiers joined him in cleaning the place. Once cleaned up Caliph Umar took off his cloak, prayed and left there. It was the first prayer of Muslims in the Masjid Al Aqsa after the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).

Caliph Umar immediately ordered the restoration of the mosque. A huge timber mosque, Masjid Al Marwani, with a capacity to accommodate 3000 worshippers was erected on this site at the southernmost wall of the Noble Sanctuary. They then started praying in this holy place. This was the most peaceful manner Jerusalem was conquered and great status of this mosque was restored after the affront committed by the Christians.

Under Caliph Umar’s generosity those who wanted to leave were allowed to do so with all their possessions while others who opted to stay were guaranteed protection for their lives, property and places of worship. Later Caliph Umar reversed the four hundred year Christian ban on Jews, allowed them to return to Jerusalem and granted Christians free use of their holy sites .Thus he turned Jerusalem into a city where Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived in tolerance, peace and harmony.

This opened the doors to the Jews who were denied access to Jerusalem. Throughout the Muslim rule of Jerusalem,from 637 to 1917 except for two relatively short periods, Jerusalem maintained its rightful title of 'The Holy City'.

### Conquests

Umar's caliphate is notable for its vast conquests, aided by brilliant field commanders, he was able to incorporate present day Iraq, Iran, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Egypt, and part of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan and south western Pakistan into the Caliphate. During his reign, the Byzantines lost more than three fourths of their territory and in Persia, the Sassanid Empire ceased to exist.

Historians estimate more than 4,050 cities were conquered during the reign of Umar

Prior to his death in 644, Umar had ceased all military expeditions apparently to consolidate his rule in recently conquered Roman Egypt and the newly conquered Sassanid Empire (642–644). At his death in November 644, his rule extended from present day Libya in the west to the Indus river in the east and the Oxus river in the north.

### Khalid ibn al-Walid

</summary>

Khalid ibn al-Walid ibn al-Mughira al-Makhzumi (died 642) was an Arab Muslim commander in the service of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the Rashidun caliphs Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) and Umar (r. 634–644). He played the leading military role in the Ridda wars against rebel tribes in Arabia in 632–633, the initial campaigns in Sasanian Iraq in 633–634 and the conquest of Byzantine Syria in 634–638.

A horseman of the Quraysh tribe's aristocratic clan, the Makhzum, which ardently opposed Muhammad, Khalid played the instrumental role in defeating the Muslims at the Battle of Uhud in 625. Following his conversion to Islam in 627 or 629, he was made a commander by Muhammad, who bestowed on him the title Sayf Allah ('the Sword of God'). Khalid coordinated the safe withdrawal of Muslim troops during the abortive expedition to Mu'ta against the Arab allies of the Byzantines in 629 and led the Bedouin contingents of the Muslim army during the capture of Mecca and the Battle of Hunayn in c. 630. After Muhammad's death, Khalid was appointed to suppress or subjugate Arab tribes in Najd and the Yamama (both regions in central Arabia) opposed to the nascent Muslim state, defeating the rebel leaders Tulayha at the Battle of Buzakha in 632 and Musaylima at the Battle of Aqraba in 633.

Khalid subsequently moved against the largely Christian Arab tribes and the Sasanian Persian garrisons of the Euphrates valley in Iraq. He was reassigned by Abu Bakr to command the Muslim armies in Syria and he led his men there on an unconventional march across a long, waterless stretch of the Syrian Desert, boosting his reputation as a military strategist. As a result of decisive victories against the Byzantines at Ajnadayn (634), Fahl (634 or 635), Damascus (634–635) and Yarmouk (636), the Muslims under Khalid conquered most of Syria. He was afterward demoted from the high command by Umar. Khalid continued service as the key lieutenant of his successor Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah in the sieges of Homs and Aleppo and the Battle of Qinnasrin, all in 637–638, which collectively precipitated the retreat from Syria of imperial Byzantine troops under Emperor Heraclius. Umar dismissed Khalid from his governorship of Qinnasrin afterward and he died in Medina or Homs in 642.

Khalid is generally considered by historians to be one of early Islam's most seasoned and accomplished generals and he is commemorated throughout the Arab world. The Islamic tradition credits Khalid for his battlefield tactics and effective leadership of the early Muslim conquests, but accuses him of illicitly executing Arab tribesmen who had accepted Islam, namely members of the Banu Jadhima during the lifetime of Muhammad and Malik ibn Nuwayra during the Ridda wars, and moral and fiscal misconduct in Syria. His military fame disturbed some of the pious early Muslims, including Umar, who feared it could develop into a personality cult.

#### Great famine

In 638 CE, Arabia fell into severe drought followed by a famine. Soon after, the reserves of food at Medina began to run out. Umar ordered caravans of supplies from Syria and Iraq, and personally supervised their distribution. His actions saved countless lives throughout Arabia. The first governor to respond was Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, the governor of Syria and supreme commander of the Rashidun army.

Later, Abu Ubaidah paid a personal visit to Medina and acted as an officer of disaster management, which was headed personally by Umar. For internally displaced people, Umar hosted a dinner every night at Medina.

#### Great plague

While famine was ending in Arabia, many districts in Syria and Palestine were devastated by plague. While Umar was on his way to visit Syria, at Elat, he was received by Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, governor of Syria, who informed him about the plague and its intensity, and suggested that Umar go back to Medina. Umar tried to persuade Abu Ubaidah to come with him to Medina, but he declined to leave his troops in that critical situation. Abu Ubaidah died in 639 of the plague, which also cost the lives of 25,000 Muslims in Syria. After the plague had weakened, in late 639, Umar visited Syria for political and administrative re-organization, as most of the veteran commanders and governors had died of the plague.

#### Welfare state

To be close to the poor, Umar lived in a simple mud hut without doors and walked the streets every evening. After consulting with the poor, Umar established the first welfare state, Bayt al-mal.The Bayt al-mal aided the Muslim and non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The Bayt al-mal ran for hundreds of years, from the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century through the Umayyad period (661–750) and well into the Abbasid era. Umar also introduced a child benefit and pensions for the children and the elderly.

#### Free trade

Local populations of Jews and Christians, persecuted as religious minorities and taxed heavily to finance the Byzantine–Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests. As new areas were attached to the Caliphate, they also benefited from free trade, while trading with other areas in the Caliphate (to encourage commerce, in Islam trade is not taxed, but wealth is subject to the zakat). Since the so-called Constitution of Medina, drafted by Muhammad, the Jews and the Christians continued to use their own laws in the Caliphate and had their own judges.

#### Assassination

In 644, Umar was assassinated by a Persian slave named Abu Lu'lu'a Firuz. His motivation for the assassination is not clear. One possible explanation was that it was done in response to the Muslim conquest of Persia. The assassination was planned several months earlier. In October 644, Umar undertook a Hajj to Mecca, during which the assassins pronounced Umar's imminent death that year, and the massive crowd of the congregation was used by the conspirators as a veil to hide themselves.

On 31 October 644, Abu Lu'lu'a attacked Umar while he was leading the morning prayers, stabbing him six times in the belly and finally in the navel, that proved fatal.

Umar died of the wounds three days later on Wednesday 3 November 644 (26 Dhu al-Hijjah 23 AH).

He was buried at the Green Dome in al-Masjid al-Nabawi alongside Muhammad and caliph Abu Bakr by the permission of Aisha.

#### Selecting Next Caliph

On his deathbed, Umar vacillated on his succession. Umar finally appointed a committee of six persons to choose a caliph from amongst them: Abdur Rahman bin Awf, Saad ibn Abi Waqqas, Talha ibn Ubaidullah, Uthman ibn Affan, Ali ibn Abi Talib and Zubayr ibn al-Awwam.

All six are among the ten to whom Paradise was promised according to a hadith. The only one out of the 'famous ten' left out of the committee who was still alive at the time was Saeed ibn Zaid, the cousin and brother-in-law of Umar. He was excluded on the basis of being related by blood and of the same tribe as Umar. Umar had a policy of not appointing anyone related to him to a position of authority even if they were qualified by his standards.

Umar appointed a band of fifty armed soldiers to protect the house where the meeting was proceeding. Until the appointment of the next caliph, Umar appointed a notable Sahabi and mawla, Suhayb ar-Rumi (Suhayb the Roman), as a caretaker caliph. While the meeting for selection of a caliph was proceeding, Abdulrahman ibn Abu Bakr and Abdur Rahman bin Awf revealed that they saw the dagger used by Abu Lu'lu'a, the assassin of Umar. A night before Umar's assassination, reported Abdur Rahman bin Awf, he saw Hurmuzan, Jafina and Abu Lu'lu'a, while they were suspiciously discussing something. Surprised by his presence, the dagger fell; it was the same two-sided dagger used in the assassination. Abdulrahman ibn Abu Bakr, son of the late caliph Abu Bakr, confirmed that, a few days before Umar's assassination, he saw this dagger in Hurmuzan's possession. After this revelation, it seemed clear that it had been planned by the Persians residing in Medina.

Umar died on 3 November 644; on 7 November Uthman succeeded him as caliph.

## 644-656: Uthman ibn Affan

</summary>

* 644-650 Muslims conquer Cyprus, Tripoli in North Africa and establish Muslim rule in Afghanistan and Sind.
* 650 Uthman orders the establishment of one "true" Quran while destroying the others.
* 656 Caliph Uthman is assassinated by malcontent Muslims soldiers, who acclaim Ali ibn Abu Talib as the new caliph, but not all accept Ali's rule.

Uthman (Arabic: عثمان, romanized: ʿUthmān; c. 576 or 579 – June 656), also spelled Osman, was the third Rashidun caliph, ruling from November 644 until his assassination. He ruled for twelve years, the longest of all Rashidun caliphs, and during his reign, the Rashidun Caliphate reached its greatest extent. He is known for having ordered the compilation of the first standard version of the Quran.

Belonging to the Quraysh's aristocratic Umayyad clan, Uthman was an affluent merchant of Taif. Following his conversion to Islam in 611, he became a prominent companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. In 615, Uthman married Muhammad's daughter Ruqayya and following her death, to another of Muhammad's daughter Umm Kulthum. His wives having been daughters of Muhammad earned him the honorific title Dhū al-Nurayn ('Possessor of the Two Lights'). Though Uthman didn't participate in the early Muslim battles, he extensively contributed his wealth in support of the Muslims. After Muhammad's death in 632, Uthman served as a close aide to the first and second caliphs Abu Bakr (r. 632–634) and Umar (r. 634–644) respectively. On his deathbed, Umar formed a six-member committee, including Uthman, to chose the next caliph amongst themselves which eventually elected Uthman.

Uthman continued his predecessor's policies of centralization and expansion, but notably initiated a relatively new tax policy, and also assigned his Umayyad kinsman to prominent roles. Under Uthman, the caliphate concluded its conquest of Persia, and also continued successful expansions into Byzantine territories. He was the first caliph to institute an integrated Muslim navy. Though Uthman was highly successful in expanding the caliphate, his nepotistic policies received him vehement opposition from numerous Muslims. In June 656, a group of Egyptian rebels besieged Uthman's house, and assassinated the caliph. The caliph was buried at a local Jewish cemetery, which was later extended to al-Baqi. His assassination marked the start of the First Muslim Civil War, as Uthman's brother-in-law Ali (r. 656–661) was elected the fourth caliph.

Uthman is viewed by historians to be one of the most successful caliphs. From an expansionist perspective, he is regarded as skilled in conflict management, as is evident from how he dealt with the heated and troubled early Muslim conquered territories. In Sunni Islam, Uthman is considered a devout and pious caliph, and also viewed as the third most righteous companion of Muhammad.

#### Election

In 644, the second caliph Umar was brutally wounded by the Persian slave Abu Lu'lu'a Firuz. Umar, on his deathbed, formed a committee (shūra) of six people to choose the next caliph from amongst themselves. The committee included Uthman, his brother-in-law Ali, childhood friend Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf, and three of Muhammad's other prominent companions Talha ibn Ubayd Allah, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas. Umar commanded that, after his death, the committee should reach a final decision within three days, and the next caliph should take the oath of office on the fourth day.

On 6 November 644, the process took place, in which Talha was absent. Uthman and Ali voted for each other, Zubayr favored the former, and Sa'd supported the latter.  Following Abd al-Rahman's decision, the committee officially chose Uthman the third caliph and pledged their allegiance (ba'yah).

#### Compilation of the Quran

In about 650 CE, Uthman began noticing slight differences in pronunciation of the Quran as Islam expanded beyond the Arabian Peninsula into Persia, the Levant, and North Africa. In order to preserve the sanctity of the text, he ordered a committee headed by Zayd ibn Thabit to use caliph Abu Bakr's copy and prepare a standard copy of the Qur'an. Thus, within 20 years of Muhammad's death, the Quran was committed to written form. That text became the model from which copies were made and promulgated throughout the urban centers of the Muslim world, and other versions are believed to have been destroyed.

#### Economic and social administration

Uthman was a shrewd businessman and a successful trader from his youth, which contributed greatly to the Rashidun Empire. Umar had established a public allowance and, on assuming office, Uthman increased it by about 25%. Umar had placed a ban on the sale of lands and the purchase of agricultural lands in conquered territories. Uthman withdrew these restrictions, in view of the fact that the trade could not flourish. Uthman also permitted people to draw loans from the public treasury. Under Umar, it had been laid down as a policy that the lands in conquered territories were not to be distributed among the combatants, but were to remain the property of the previous owners. The army felt dissatisfied at this decision, but Umar suppressed the opposition with a strong hand. Uthman followed the policy devised by Umar and there were more conquests, and the revenues from land increased considerably.

Umar had been very strict in the use of money from the public treasury—indeed, apart from the meagre allowance that had been sanctioned in his favour, Umar took no money from the treasury. He did not receive any gifts, nor did he allow any of his family members to accept any gifts from any quarter. During the time of Uthman, these restrictions were relaxed. Although Uthman still drew no personal allowance from the treasury, nor did he receive a salary, as he was a wealthy man with sufficient resources of his own, but, unlike Umar, Uthman accepted gifts and allowed his family members to do likewise from certain quarters. Uthman honestly expressed that he had the right to utilize the public funds according to his best judgment, and no one criticized him for that. The economic reforms introduced by Uthman had far-reaching effects; Muslims, as well as non-Muslims of the Rashidun Empire, enjoyed an economically prosperous life during his reign.

#### Military expansion

During his rule, Uthman's military-style was more autonomically in nature as he delegated much military authority to his trusted kinsmen of the Umayyad clan. Uthman appointed these Umayyad governors as the administers of each province. This strategy of Uthman was an effective method of rule as this much independent policy allowed more expansion, enlarging the caliphate's territories.

Muawiyah I had been appointed the governor of Syria by Umar in 639 to stop Byzantine attacks from the sea during the Arab-Byzantine Wars. He succeeded his elder brother Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, who died in a plague, along with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, the governor before him, and 25,000 other people. Now under Uthman's rule in 649, Muawiyah was allowed to set up a navy, manned by Monophysitic Christians, Copts, and Jacobite Syrian Christian sailors and Muslim troops, which defeated the Byzantine navy at the Battle of the Masts in 655, opening up the Mediterranean.

In 651, (31 AH), Uthman sent Abdullah ibn Zubayr and Abdullah ibn Saad to reconquer the Maghreb, where he met the army of Gregory the Patrician, Exarch of Africa and relative of Heraclius, which is recorded to have numbered between 120,000 and 200,000 soldiers, Although another estimate was recorded, Gregory's army was put at 20,000. The opposing forces clashed at Sabuthilag (or Sufetula), which became the name of this battle. Records from al-Bidayah wal Nihayah state that Abdullah's troops were completely surrounded by Gregory's army. However, Abdullah ibn Zubayr spotted Gregory in his chariot and asked Abdullah ibn Sa'd to lead a small detachment to intercept him. The interception was successful, and Gregory was slain by Zubayr's ambush party. Consequently, the morale of Byzantine army started crumbling and soon they were routed.

Some Muslim sources claim that after the conquest of northern Africa was completed by Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Abdullah ibn Sa'd continued to Spain. Spain had first been invaded some sixty years earlier during the caliphate of Uthman. Other prominent Muslim historians, like Ibn Kathir, have quoted the same narration. In the description of this campaign, two of Abdullah ibn Saad's generals, Abdullah ibn Nafiah ibn Husain, and Abdullah ibn Nafi' ibn Abdul Qais, were ordered to invade the coastal areas of Spain by sea, aided by a Berber force. They succeeded in conquering the coastal areas of Al-Andalus. It is not known where the Muslim force landed, what resistance they met, and what parts of Spain they actually conquered. However, it is clear that the Muslims did conquer some portion of Spain during the caliphate of Uthman, presumably establishing colonies on its coast. 

Although raids by Berbers and Muslims were conducted against the Visigothic Kingdom in Spain during the late 7th century, there is no evidence that Spain was invaded nor that parts of it were conquered or settled by Muslims prior to the 711 campaign by Tariq.

Abdullah ibn Saad also achieved success in the Caliphate's first decisive naval battle against the Byzantine Empire, the Battle of the Masts.

To the east, Ahnaf ibn Qais, chief of Banu Tamim and a veteran commander who conquered Shustar earlier, launched a series of further military expansions by further mauling Yazdegerd III near Oxus River in Turkmenistan and later crushing a military coalition of Sassanid loyalists and Hephthalite Empire in the Siege of Herat. Later, the governor of Basra, Abdullah ibn Aamir also led a number of successful campaigns, ranging from the suppression of revolts in Fars, Kerman, Sistan, and Khorasan, to the opening of new fronts for conquest in Transoxiana and Afghanistan.

In the next year, AD 652, Futh Al-Buldan of Baladhuri writes that Balochistan was re-conquered during the campaign against the revolt in Kermān, under the command of Majasha ibn Mas'ud. It was the first time that western Balochistan had come directly under the laws of the Caliphate and it paid an agricultural tribute. The military campaigns under Uthman's rule were generally successful, except for a few in the kingdom of Nubia, on the lower Nile.

#### Armed revolt against Uthman

The politics of Egypt played the major role in the revolt against the caliphate. The Governor of Egypt under Uthman, Abd Allah ibn Sa'd was criticized by Egyptians for heavy-handed governing and tax policies. After demands from the Egyptians, Uthman dismissed Abd Allah ibn S'ad as Egypt's governor and replaced him with Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr.

After getting the post, while Ibn Abi Bakr and his supporters were on their way to Egypt, they came across the Caliph's envoy. The rebels searched for the envoy's personal belongings and founded a letter purportedly written by Uthman, which was to be sent to Abd Allah ibn Sa'd. In the letter, Uthman purportedly ordered death punishment for Ibn Abi Bakr and his supporters. Enraged by the letter, Ibn Abi Bakr and his supporters, then set off to Medina to threaten the caliph. After the rebels arrived, Ali saw the letter and had a conversation with Uthman, who claimed to have been unaware of the letter.[66] Historians have suggested that the letter may have been authored by Marwan ibn al-Hakam without Uthman's knowledge.

From Egypt, Kufa, and Basra, contingents of about 1,000 people apiece were sent to Medina, each with instructions to assassinate Uthman and overthrow the government. Representatives of the Egyptian contingent waited on Ali, and offered him the Caliphate, but he turned them down. Representatives of the contingent from Kufa waited on Al-Zubayr, and those from Basra waited on Talha, each offering them their allegiance as the next Caliph, but both were similarly turned down.

The rebels realized that the people in Mecca supported Uthman and were not inclined to listen to them. Before returning to Syria, the governor Muawiyah, Uthman's cousin, suggested that Uthman should come with him to Syria as the atmosphere there was peaceful. Uthman rejected his offer, saying that he didn't want to leave the city of Muhammad (Medina). Muawiyah then suggested that he be allowed to send a strong force from Syria to Medina to guard Uthman against any possible attempt by rebels to harm him. Uthman rejected it too, saying that the Syrian forces in Medina would be an incitement to civil war, and he could not be party to such a move.

#### Siege and Assassination of Uthman

The early stage of the siege of Uthman's house was not severe, but, as the days passed, the rebels intensified the pressure against Uthman. With the departure of the pilgrims from Medina to Mecca, the rebel position was strengthened further, and as a consequence the crisis deepened. The rebels understood that, after the Hajj, the Muslims, gathered at Mecca from all parts of the Muslim world, might march to Medina to relieve Uthman. They therefore decided to take action against Uthman before the pilgrimage was over. During the siege, Uthman was asked by his supporters, who outnumbered the rebels, to let them fight, but Uthman refused, in an effort to avoid bloodshed among Muslims. Unfortunately for Uthman, violence still occurred. The gates of the house of Uthman were shut and guarded by the renowned warrior Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, along with Ali's sons, Hasan ibn Ali and Husain ibn Ali.

The rebels besieged Uthman and prevented him from getting water. After Ali was informed about this, he sent three waterskins brimming with water, which reached the thirsty caliph.

In June 656, a group of rebels climbed from the back of Uthman's house, crept inside, unbeknownst to the gate guards. While Uthman was reading the Quran, the rebels plunged into the caliph's room and struck blows at his head, from which Uthman subsequently died at around the age of 77 or 80 years old.

## 656-661: Ali ibn Abi Talib

</summary>

* 656-660 The first fitnah. civil war ensues.
* 656 The Battle of the Camel. Aisha, Talhah and Zubayr with the army meet Ali for not avenging Uthman's murder. They are defeated by Ali's partisans.
* In Syria the opposition is led by Uthman's kinsman, Mauwiyyah ibn Abi Sufyan.
* 657 An attempt to arbitrate between the two sides. Muawiyyah deposes Ali and is proclaimed caliph in Jerusalem.
* The Kharajites secede from Ali's camp.
* 661 Ali is murdered by a Kharajite extremist.
* Ali's supporters claim his son Hasan as the next caliph.    

Ali ibn Abi Talib (علي بن أبي طالب, ; 600 – 28 January 661) was the fourth Rashidun caliph, reigning from 656 until his assassination in 661. He was a cousin, son-in-law and companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Ali is one of the central figures in Shia Islam as the first Shia Imam and in Sunni Islam as the fourth of the "rightly guided" (rāshidūn) caliphs (name used for the first four successors to Muhammad). He was the son of Abu Talib and Fatimah bint Asad, the husband of Fatima, and the father of Hasan, Husayn, Zaynab, and Umm Kulthum.

As a child, Muhammad took care of him. After Muhammad's invitation of his close relatives, Ali became one of the first believers in Islam at the age of about 9 to 11. He then publicly accepted his invitation on Yawm al-Inzar and Muhammad called him his brother, guardian and successor. He helped Muhammad emigrate on the night of Laylat al-Mabit, by sleeping in his place. After migrating to Medina and establishing a brotherhood pact between the Muslims, Muhammad chose him as his brother. In Medina, he was the flag bearer in most of the wars and became famous for his bravery.

The issue of his right in the post-Muhammad caliphate caused a major rift between Muslims and divided them into Shia and Sunni groups. On his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage, at Ghadir Khumm, Muhammad uttered the phrase, "Whoever I am his Mawla, this Ali is his Mawla." But the meaning of Mawla was disputed by Shias and Sunnis. On this basis, the Shias believe in the establishment of the Imamate and caliphate regarding Ali, and the Sunnis interpret the word as friendship and love. While Ali was preparing Muhammad's body for burial, a group of Muslims met at Saqifah and pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr. Ali pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr, after six months, but did not take part in the wars and political activity, except for the election of the third caliph Uthman. However, he advised the three caliphs in religious, judicial, and political matters whenever they wanted.

After Uthman was killed, Ali was elected as the next Caliph, which coincided with the first civil wars between Muslims. Ali faced two separate opposition forces: a group led by Aisha, Talha, and Zubayr in Mecca, who wanted to convene a council to determine the caliphate; and another group led by Mu'awiya in the Levant, who demanded revenge for Uthman's blood. He defeated the first group in the Battle of the Camel; but in the end, the Battle of Siffin with Mu'awiya was militarily ineffective, and led to an arbitration which ended politically against him. Then, in the year 38 AH (658-659), he fought with the Kharijites - who considered Ali's acceptance of arbitration as heresy, and revolted against him - in Nahrawan and defeated them. Ali was eventually killed in the mosque of Kufa by the sword of one of the Kharijites, Ibn Muljam Moradi, and was buried outside the city of Kufa. Later his shrine and the city of Najaf were built around his tomb. Despite the impact of religious differences on Muslim historiography, sources agree that Ali strictly observed religious duties and avoided worldly possessions. Some writers accused him of a lack of political skill and flexibility. According to Wilferd Madelung, Ali did not want to involve himself in the game of political deception which deprived him of success in life, but, in the eyes of his admirers, he became an example of the piety of the primary un-corrupted Islam, as well as the chivalry of pre-Islamic Arabia. Several books are dedicated to the hadiths, sermons, and prayers narrated by him.

#### Election

When Uthman was killed in 656 CE by rebels from Egypt, Kufa and Basra, the potential candidates for caliphate were Ali and Talha. The Umayyads had fled Medina, and the Egyptians, prominent Muhajirun, and Ansar had gained control of the city. Among the Egyptians, Talha enjoyed some support. However, the Basrians and Kufis, who had heeded Ali's opposition to the use of violence, and most of the Ansar openly supported Ali's caliphate, and finally got the upper hand.

The caliphate was offered to Ali and he accepted the position after a few days. According to Madelung, many of Muhammad's companions expressed the wish to pledge allegiance to him after the assassination of Uthman. At first, Ali declined. It has been suggested that the assassination of Uthman created an atmosphere of tumult and panic. This atmosphere might have compelled Ali into accepting the caliphate to prevent further chaos.

#### Ruling style

By virtue of his kinship with Muhammad and his profound knowledge of Islam's roots, Ali laid claim to the religious authority to interpret the Quran and Sunnah to meet the needs of a rapidly-changing caliphate.

Ali opposed a centralized control over provincial revenues, favoring an equal distribution of the taxes and booty amongst Muslims, following the precedent of Muhammad. This practice, according to Poonawala, might be an indication of Ali's policy to give equal value to all Muslims who served Islam, a policy which later garnered him considerable support among the traditional tribal leaders. According to Shaban, Ali's policies earned him the strong support of the underprivileged groups, including the Ansar, who were subordinated after Muhammad by the Quraysh leadership, and the Qurra or Quranic reciters who sought pious Islamic leadership. The successful formation of this diverse coalition is attributed to Ali's charisma by Shaban. In a notable incident, it has been reported that Ali rejected the request by his brother, Aqil, for public funds and instead offered to pay Aqil from his personal estate.

According to Heck, Ali also forbade Muslim fighters from looting and instead distributed the taxes as salaries among the warriors, in equal proportions. This might have been the first subject of the dispute between Ali and the group that later constituted the Kharijites. Since the majority of Ali's subjects were nomads and peasants, he was concerned with agriculture. In particular, he instructed his top general, Malik al-Ashtar, to pay more attention to land development than short-term taxation.

## 661: Hasan ibn Ali

</summary>

Hasan ibn Ali (حسن ابن علي, ; 625 – 2 April 670) was the eldest son of Ali and Fatima and a grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. He briefly ruled as caliph from January 661 until August 661. He is considered the second Shia Imam, succeeding Ali and preceding his brother, Husayn. In Sunni Islam, Hasan is considered one of the greatest sahaba and part of Muhammad's family. Part of the ahl al-bayt and the ahl al-kisa, he participated in the event of Mubahala. Muhammad described Hasan and Husayn as "the masters of youth in Paradise".

During the caliphate of Ali (r. 656 – 661), Hasan accompanied him in the military campaigns of the First Muslim Civil War. After Ali's assassination in 661, Hasan was subsequently acknowledged caliph in Kufa. His sovereignty was unrecognized by Syria's governor Mu'awiya I (r. 661 – 680), who led an army into Kufa to press the former for abdication. In response, Hasan sent a vanguard under Ubayd Allah ibn al-Abbas to block Mu'awiya's advance until he arrived with the main army. Meanwhile, Hasan was severely wounded in an abortive assassination attempt made by the Kharijites, a faction opposed to both Ali and Mu'awiya. This attack demoralized Hasan's army, and many deserted. On the other hand, Ubayd Allah and most of his troops defected after Mu'awiya bribed him. In August 661 (Rabi al-Thani 41 AH), Hasan signed a peace treaty with Mu'awiya on the basis that the latter should rule in compliance with the Quran and the sunna, a council appointed his successor, and his supporters received amnesty. Hasan retired from politics and abdicated in Medina where he eventually died either by a long-term illness or poisoning at the instigation of Mu'awiya, who wanted to install his son Yazid (r. 680–683), as his successor.

Critics of Hasan call his treaty with Mu'awiya an indication of weakness, saying that he had intended to surrender from the beginning and fought half-heartedly. His supporters maintain that Hasan's abdication was inevitable after his soldiers mutinied, and he was motivated by the desire for unity and peace in the Muslim community; Muhammad reportedly predicted that Hasan would make peace among the Muslims. Another Sunni hadith (also attributed to Muhammad) predicted that the prophetic succession would endure for thirty years, which may have been interpreted by at least some early Sunni scholars as evidence that Hasan's caliphate was rightly-guided (rāshid).

## Miracle of Early Islamic Expansion

</summary>

Arabia at that time was between two greatest super empires the Byzantine and Persian, who were fighting against each other for 400 years. and within 30 years after the prophet Muhammadﷺ   died, Arabs conquered both of these empires.

They did not have buildings, they did not even have a government. They were never united. by modern historic scholars considers this as the same if Escimoes of 2000's conquerred Russia and USA.

## 603-680: Abu Huraira 🐈 (603 - 680)

</summary>

Abdur-Rahman ibn Sakhr Al-Dawsri Al-Zahrani (عبد الرحمن بن صخر الدوسري‎; c. 603 – 680), better known as Abu Hurayrah 🐈 (or Hurairah 🐈; Arabic: أبو هريرة, translates to the father of the kitten 🐈), was one of the companions of Islamic prophet Muhammad and, according to Sunni Islam, the most prolific narrator of hadith.

He was known by the kunyah Abu Hurayrah 🐈 "Father of a Kitten", in reference to his attachment to cats 🐈🐈, and he was a member of Suffah. Later during caliphate era, Abu Hurairah 🐈 served as Ulama teacher, governor, soldier, and Hadith auditor. Among his other epithets is ذو الوينسين or "Possessor of the Two Elbows", as his own narrations claim Prophet Muhammad praised him for his sturdy elbows and righteous character.

    "I was called Abu Hurairah 🐈 because I would tend to the goats of my family, and one day I found a stray kitten 🐈 which I placed in my sleeve. When I returned to my people they heard the kitten purr 🐈 in my sleeve and they asked, "What is that, O 'Abd Shams?" I replied, "A kitten I found 🐈." "So you are Abu Hurairah 🐈 (Father of cats 🐈)," they responded and the name stuck thereafter."

Abu Hurairah 🐈 acknowledged by Muslim scholars for his extraordinary photographic memory which allowed him to memorize massive numbers of over 5,000 hadiths which later produced more than 500,000 chain narrations, or Isnad which make Abu Hurairah 🐈 an exemplar role model for Hadith studies scholars. It is said by Abu Hurairah 🐈 himself the only one who surpassed him regarding hadith were Abd Allah ibn Amr ibn al-As, another companion who serve as writer assistant of Muhammad and author of "Al-Sahifah al-Sadiqah", the first Hadith book in history.

Abu Hurairah 🐈 hadiths has been used by most, if not all scholars of Islam across the ages for Islamic learning about Aqidah, Islamic eschatology, Tafsir, Fiqh, Biographical evaluation, Prophetic biography, and Fatwa verdicts.

According to al-Dhahabi, Abu Hurairah 🐈 hailed from the Arab tribe of Zahran of the prominent clan of Banu Daws and was born in the region of Al-Baha which was in Asir at that time. It is unclear as to what his real name is, the most popular opinion being that it was 'Abd al-Raḥmān ibn Ṣakhr (عبد الرحمن بن صخر).

#### Life as Muslim

Abu Hurairah 🐈 embraced Islam through Tufayl ibn Amr, the chieftain of his tribe, as Tufayl had returned to his village after meeting Muhammad and became a Muslim in the early years of his mission. Abu Hurairah was one of the first to respond to his call, unlike the majority of Tufayl's tribesmen, who embraced Islam later. Abu Hurairah 🐈 accompanied Tufayl to Mecca to meet Muhammad who renamed him Abd al-Rahman ("servant of the Merciful") from Abd al Sham, or some said Abd al Ghanm.

During his early years embracing Islam in Medina, Abu Hurairah 🐈 became disciple of Suffah. Abu Hurayrah 🐈 spent 2 years 3 months approximately in the company of Muhammad and went on expeditions and journeys with him. However, according to Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri in his The Sealed Nectar, the Dhat ar-Riqa' campaign took place after the fall of Khaybar and not as part of the invasion of the Najd. This is supported by the fact that Abu Hurairah 🐈 and Abu Musa al-Ash'ari witnessed the battle as Abu Hurairah embraced Islam only some days before Khaybar, and Abu Musa Al-Ash'ari came back from Abyssinia and joined Muhammad at Khaybar. The rules relating to the prayer of fear which Muhammad observed at Dhat Ar-Riqa' campaign, were revealed at the Invasion of the 'Asfan and this, scholars such as al-Dhahabi, has recorded the invasion were took place after the Battle of the Trench, which nodded by Mubarakpuri. Nevertheless, consensus of Muslim historians has placed that Abu Hurairah 🐈 came into historical record after the battle of khaybar. Then he afterwards participated in battle of Mu'tah, conquest of Mecca, battle of Hunayn, and Expedition of Tabuk.

Abu Hurairah 🐈 were recorded has participated during the Expedition of Dhat al-Riqa'which took place in the Najd, a large area of tableland in the Arabian Peninsula in Rabi' al-Thani or Jumada al-awwal, 4 AH (or the beginning of 5 AH), as Muhammad received the news that certain tribes of the Ghatafan were assembling at Dhat al-Riqa' with suspicious purposes. The Muslim fighters penetrated deep into their land until they reached a spot called Nakhla, where they came across some bedouins of Ghatafan.

Later, Abu Hurairah 🐈 were sent as Muezzin to al-Ala al-Hadhrami. And Muhammad entrusted him with some works such as preserving Ramadan zakat funds.

## **732**: Abu Hanifa pioneers the study of fiqh

</summary>

Abū Ḥanīfa al-Nuʿmān ibn Thābit b. Zūṭā ibn Marzubān ( أبو حنيفة نعمان بن ثابت بن زوطا بن مرزبان; c. 699 – 767 CE), known as Abū Ḥanīfa for short, or reverently as Imam Abū Ḥanīfa by Sunni Muslims, was an 8th-century Sunni Muslim theologian and jurist of Persian origin, who became the eponymous founder of the Hanafi school of Sunni jurisprudence, which has remained the most widely practiced law school in the Sunni tradition, predominates in Central Asia, Afghanistan, Persia (until the 16th century), Balkans, Russia, Chechnya, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Muslims in India, Turkey, and some parts of the Arab world.

Some followers call him al-Imām al-Aʿẓam ("The Greatest Imam") and Sirāj al-aʾimma ("The Lamp of the Imams") in Sunni Islam.

Born to a Muslim family in Kufa, Abu Hanifa is known to have travelled to the Hejaz region of Arabia in his youth, where he studied in Mecca and Medina. As his career as a theologian and jurist progressed, Abu Hanifa became known for favoring the use of reason in his legal rulings (faqīh dhū raʾy) and even in his theology. Abu Hanifa's theological school is claimed to be what would later develop into the Maturidi school of Sunni theology.

### Early life and scholarship

There is scant biographical information about Abu Hanifa. It is generally known that he worked a producer and seller of "khazz", a type of silk clothing material. He attended lectures on jurisprudence by the Kufan scholar Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman (d. 737). He also possibly learnt jurisprudence (fiqh) by the Meccan scholar Ata ibn Abi Rabah (d. c. 733) while on Hajj. According to the historian Joseph Schacht, other scholars Abu Hanifa is held to have learned from should be "treated with caution".

Abu Hanifa succeeded Hammad, when the latter died, as the principal authority on Islamic law in Kufa and the chief representative of the Kufan school of jurisprudence. Abu Hanifa gradually gained influence as an authority on legal questions, founding a moderate rationalist school of Islamic jurisprudence that was named after him.

### Adulthood and death

In 763, al-Mansur, the Abbasid caliph offered Abu Hanifa the post of Chief Judge of the State, but he declined the offer, choosing to remain independent. His student Abu Yusuf was later appointed Qadi Al-Qudat (Chief Judge of the State) by the Caliph Harun al-Rashid.

In his reply to al-Mansur, Abu Hanifa said that he was not fit for the post. Al-Mansur, who had his own ideas and reasons for offering the post, lost his temper and accused Abu Hanifa of lying.

"If I am lying," Abu Hanifa said, "then my statement is doubly correct. How can you appoint a liar to the exalted post of a Chief Qadi (Judge)?"

Incensed by this reply, the ruler had Abu Hanifa arrested, locked in prison and tortured. He was never fed nor cared for. Even there, the jurist continued to teach those who were permitted to come to him.

On 15 Rajab 150 (August 15, 767), Abu Hanifa died in prison. The cause of his death is not clear, as some say that Abu Hanifa issued a legal opinion for bearing arms against Al-Mansur, and the latter had him poisoned. The fellow prisoner and Jewish Karaite founder, Anan ben David, is said to have received life-saving counsel from the subject. It was said that so many people attended his funeral that the funeral service was repeated six times for more than 50,000 people who had amassed before he was actually buried.

### Students
Yusuf ibn Abd al-Rahman al-Mizzi listed 97 hadith scholars who were his students. Most of them were famous hadith scholars, and their narrated hadiths were compiled in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim and other famous books of hadith. Imām Badr al-Din al-Ayni included another 260 students who studied Hadith and Fiqh from Abu Hanifa.

His most famous student was Imām Abu Yusuf, who served as the first chief justice in the Muslim world. Another famous student was Imām Muhammad al-Shaybani, who was the teacher of the Shafi‘i school of jurisprudence founder, Imām Al-Shafi‘i. His other students include:
* Abdullah ibn Mubarak
* Abu Nuāim Fadl Ibn Dukain
* Malik bin Mighwal
* Dawood Taa’ee
* Mandil bin Ali
* Qaasim bin Ma’n
* Hayyaaj bin Bistaam
* Hushaym bin Basheer Sulami
* Fudhayl bin Iyaadh
* Ali bin Tibyaan
* Wakee bin Jarrah
* Amr bin Maymoon
* Abu Ismah
* Zuhayr bin Mu’aawiyah
* Aafiyah bin Yazeed

### Sources and methodology
The sources from which Abu Hanifa derived Islamic law, in order of importance and preference, are: the Qur'an, the authentic narrations of the Muslim prophet Muhammad (known as hadith), consensus of the Muslim community (ijma), analogical reasoning (qiyas), juristic discretion (istihsan) and the customs of the local population enacting said law (urf). The development of analogical reason and the scope and boundaries by which it may be used is recognized by the majority of Muslim jurists, but its establishment as a legal tool is the result of the Hanafi school. While it was likely used by some of his teachers, Abu Hanifa is regarded by modern scholarship as the first to formally adopt and institute analogical reason as a part of Islamic law.

As the fourth Caliph, Ali had transferred the Islamic capital to Kufa, and many of the first generation of Muslims had settled there, the Hanafi school of law based many of its rulings on the prophetic tradition as transmitted by those first generation Muslims residing in Iraq. Thus, the Hanafi school came to be known as the Kufan or Iraqi school in earlier times. Ali and Abdullah, son of Masud formed much of the base of the school, as well as other personalities from the direct relatives (or Ahli-ll-Bayṫ) of Moḥammad from whom Abu Hanifa had studied such as Muhammad al-Baqir. Many jurists and historians had reportedly lived in Kufa, including one of Abu Hanifa's main teachers, Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman.

### Generational status
Abu Hanifa is regarded by some as one of the Tabi‘un, the generation after the Sahaba, who were the companions of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. This is based on reports that he met at least four Sahaba including Anas ibn Malik, with some even reporting that he transmitted Hadith from him and other companions of Muhammad. Others take the view that Abu Hanifa only saw around half a dozen companions, possibly at a young age, and did not directly narrate hadith from them.

Abu Hanifa was born 67 years after the death of Muhammad, but during the time of the first generation of Muslims, some of whom lived on until Abu Hanifa's youth. Anas bin Malik, Muhammad's personal attendant, died in 93 AH and another companion, Abul Tufail Amir bin Wathilah, died in 100 AH, when Abu Hanifa was 20 years old. The author of al-Khairat al-Hisan collected information from books of biographies and cited the names of Muslims of the first generation from whom it is reported that the Abu Hanifa had transmitted hadith. He counted them as sixteen, including Anas ibn Malik, Jabir ibn Abd-Allah and Sahl ibn Sa'd.

### Reception

He attained a very high status in the various fields of sacred knowledge and significantly influenced the development of Muslim theology. During his lifetime, he was acknowledged by the people as a jurist of the highest calibre.

Outside of his scholarly achievements, Abu Hanifa is popularly known amongst Sunni Muslims as a man of the highest personal qualities: a performer of good works, remarkable for his self-denial, humble spirit, devotion and pious awe of God.

The honorific title al-Imam al-A'zam ("the greatest leader") was granted to him both in communities where his legal theory is followed and elsewhere. According to John Esposito, 45% of all Muslims follow the Hanafi school.

# 9.4 The Islamic Golden Age
*******************************************

<details>
  <summary> Islamic Golden Age Briefly</summary>

The Islamic Golden Age was a period of cultural, economic, and scientific flourishing in the history of Islam, traditionally dated from the 8th century to the 14th century. This period is traditionally understood to have begun during the reign of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid (786 to 809) with the inauguration of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, the world's largest city by then, where Muslim scholars and polymaths from various parts of the world with different cultural backgrounds were mandated to gather and translate all of the known world's classical knowledge into Aramaic and Arabic.

The period is traditionally said to have ended with the collapse of the Abbasid caliphate due to Mongol invasions and the Siege of Baghdad in 1258. A few scholars date the end of the golden age around 1350 linking with the Timurid Renaissance, while several modern historians and scholars place the end of the Islamic Golden Age as late as the end of 15th to 16th centuries meeting with the Islamic gunpowder empires.

### Caliphate of Harun al-Rushdi

</summary>

A great cultural renaissance in Baghdad and other cities of the empire. Besides patronizing scholarship, science and arts, the caliph also encourages the study of fiqh and the anthologization of ahadith which will enable the formation of a coherent body of Islamic law (Shariah).  

</details><details><summary>711-795: imam Al-Malik ibn Anas</summary>
Malik ibn Anas, founder of the Maliki school of jurisprudence.

Reverently known as al-Imām Mālik (ٱلْإِمَام مَالِك) by Sunni Muslims, was an Arab Muslim jurist, theologian, and hadith traditionist. 
His grandfather Malik ibn Abi Amir was a student of the second Caliph of Islam Umar and was one of those involved in the collection of the parchments upon which Quranic texts were originally written when those were collected during the Caliph Uthman era. 

Born in the city of Medina, Malik rose to become the premier scholar of prophetic traditions in his day, which he sought to apply to "the whole legal life" in order to create a systematic method of Muslim jurisprudence which would only further expand with the passage of time. Referred to as the "Imam of Medina" by his contemporaries, Malik's views in matters of jurisprudence were highly cherished both in his own life and afterwards, and he became the founder of one of the four schools of Sunni law, the Maliki, which became the normative rite for the Sunni practice of much of North Africa, Al-Andalus (until expulsion of Muslims), a vast portion of Egypt, and some parts of Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Iraq, and Khorasan, and the prominent Sufi orders, including the Shadiliyya and the Tijaniyyah.

Perhaps Malik's most famous accomplishment in the annals of Islamic history is, however, his compilation of the Muwatta, one of the oldest and most revered Sunni hadith collections and one of "the earliest surviving Muslim law-book[s]," in which Malik attempted to "give a survey of law and justice; ritual and practice of religion according to the consensus of Islam in Medina, according to the sunna usual in Medina; and to create a theoretical standard for matters which were not settled from the point of view of consensus and sunna." Composed in the early days of the Abbasid caliphate, during which time there was a burgeoning "recognition and appreciation of the canon law" of the ruling party, Malik's work aimed to trace out a "smoothed path" (which is what al-muwaṭṭaʾ literally means) through "the farreaching differences of opinion even on the most elementary questions." Hailed as "the soundest book on earth after the Quran" by al-Shafi'i, the compilation of the Muwatta led to Malik being bestowed with such reverential epithets as "Shaykh of Islam", "Proof of the Community", "Imam of the Abode of Emigration", and "Knowledgeable Scholar of Medina" in later Sunni tradition.

Throughout Islamic history, Malik has been venerated as an exemplary figure in all the traditional schools of Sunni thought, both by the exoteric ulema and by the mystics, with the latter often designating him as a saint in their hagiographies. Malik's most notable student, Al-Shafi'i (who would himself become the founder of another of the four orthodox legal schools of Sunni law) later said of his teacher: "No one constitutes as great a favor to me in the Religion of God as Malik ... when the scholars of knowledge are mentioned, Malik is the guiding star."

### Golden Chain of Narration

Malik's chain of narrators was considered the most authentic and called Silsilat al-Dhahab or "The Golden Chain of Narrators" by notable hadith scholars including Muhammad al-Bukhari. The 'Golden Chain' of narration (i.e., that considered by the scholars of Hadith to be the most authentic) consists of Malik, who narrated from Nafi‘ Mawla ibn ‘Umar, who narrated from Ibn Umar, who narrated from Muhammad.

### Mention in hadith

Muhammad reportedly said in a hadith authenticated by Muhammad ibn Isa at-Tirmidhi: "Very soon will people beat the flanks of camels in search of knowledge, and they shall find no-one more knowledgeable than the knowledgeable scholar of Madina." Qadi Ayyad, Al-Dhahabi and others relate from Sufyan ibn Uyaynah, ‘Abd ar-Razzaq as-San‘ani, Ibn Mahdi, Yahya ibn Ma'in, Dhu’ayb ibn Imama, Ibn al-Madini, and others that they considered that scholar to be Malik ibn Anas.

### Mysticism

On the basis of several early traditions, it is evident that Malik held the early Sufis and their practices in high regard. It is related, moreover, that Malik was a strong proponent of combining the "inward science" ('ilm al-bātin) of mystical knowledge with the "outward science" of jurisprudence. For example, the famous twelfth-century Maliki jurist and judge Qadi Iyad, later venerated as a saint throughout the Iberian Peninsula, narrated a tradition in which a man asked Malik "about something in the inward science," to which Malik replied: "Truly none knows the inward science except those who know the outward science! When he knows the outward science and puts it into practice, God shall open for him the inward science - and that will not take place except by the opening of his heart and its enlightenment." In other similar traditions, it is related that Malik said: "He who practices Sufism (tasawwuf) without learning Sacred Law corrupts his faith (tazandaqa), while he who learns Sacred Law without practicing Sufism corrupts himself (tafassaqa). Only he who combines the two proves true (tahaqqaqa)."

### Sunnah of Muhammad

Malik considered following the sunnah of Muhammad to be of capital importance for every Muslim. It is reported that he said: "The sunnah is Noah's Ark. Whoever boards it is saved, and whoever remains away from it perishes."

### "I do not know"

Malik is famous for declaring: "The shield of the 'alim is: 'I do not know.' If he neglects it, he will receive a mortal blow." Elsewhere, a certain Khālid ibn Khidāsh related: "I travelled all the way from Iraq to see Mālik about forty questions. He did not answer me except on five. Then he said: ʿIbn ʿIjlān used to say: If the 'alim bypasses 'I do not know,' he will receive a mortal blow." Likewise, al-Haytham ibn Jamīl said: "I saw Mālik ibn Anas being asked forty-eight questions, and he replied to thirty-two of them: 'I do not know.'" Later on, Malik's disciple, Ibn Wahb, related: "I heard ʿAbd Allāh ibn Yazīd ibn Hurmuz say: 'The 'ulema must instill in those who sit with him the phrase 'I do not know' until it becomes a foundational principle (asl) before them and they seek refuge in it from danger."

</details><details><summary>Imam Al-Shafi'i (767 - 820)</summary>

Abū ʿAbdillāh Muḥammad ibn Idrīs al-Shāfiʿī ( أَبُو عَبْدِ ٱللهِ مُحَمَّدُ بْنُ إِدْرِيسَ ٱلشَّافِعِيُّ, 767–19 January 820 CE) was an Arab Muslim theologian, writer, and scholar, who was the first contributor of the principles of Islamic jurisprudence (Uṣūl al-fiqh). Often referred to as 'Shaykh al-Islām', al-Shāfi‘ī was one of the four great Sunni Imams, whose legacy on juridical matters and teaching eventually led to the formation of Shafi'i school of fiqh (or Madh'hab). He was the most prominent student of Imam Malik ibn Anas, and he also served as the Governor of Najar. Born in Gaza in Palestine (Jund Filastin), he also lived in Mecca and Medina in the Hejaz, Yemen, Egypt, and Baghdad in Iraq.

### Early life

Al-Shafi'i was born in Gaza by the town of Asqalan in 150 AH (767 CE). His father died in Ash-Sham while he was still a child. Fearing the waste of his sharīf lineage, his mother decided to move to Mecca when he was about two years old. Furthermore, his maternal family roots were from Yemen, and there were more members of his family in Mecca, where his mother believed he would better be taken care of. Little is known about al-Shāfi‘ī's early life in Mecca, except that he was brought up in poor circumstances and that from his youth he was devoted to learning. An account states that his mother could not afford to buy his paper, so he would write his lessons on bones, particularly shoulder-bones. He studied under Muslim ibn Khalid az-Zanji, the Mufti of Mecca then, who is thus considered to be the first teacher of Imam al-Shāfi‘ī. By the age of seven, al-Shāfi‘ī had memorised the Qur’an. At ten, he had committed Imam Malik's Muwatta' to heart, at which time his teacher would deputise him to teach in his absence. Al-Shāfi‘ī was authorised to issue fatwas at the age of fifteen.

### Apprenticeship under Imam Mālik

Al-Shāfi‘ī moved to Al-Medinah in a desire for further legal training, as was the tradition of acquiring knowledge. Accounts differ on the age in which he set out to Medina; an account placed his age at thirteen, while another stated that he was in his twenties. There, he was taught for many years by the famous Imam Malik ibn Anas, who was impressed with his memory, knowledge and intelligence. By the time of Imam Mālik's death in 179 AH (795 CE), al-Shāfi‘ī had already gained a reputation as a brilliant jurist. Even though he would later disagree with some of the views of Imam Mālik, al-Shāfi‘ī accorded the deepest respect to him by always referring to him as "the Teacher".

### Yemeni Fitna

At the age of thirty, al-Shāfi‘ī was appointed as the ‘Abbasid governor in the Yemeni city of Najran. He proved to be a just administrator but soon became entangled with factional jealousies. In 803 CE, al-Shāfi‘ī was accused of aiding the 'Alids in a revolt, and was thus summoned in chains with a number of 'Alids to the Caliph Harun ar-Rashid at Raqqa. Whilst other conspirators were put to death, al-Shafi'i's own eloquent defence convinced the Caliph to dismiss the charge. Other accounts state that the famous Hanafi jurist, Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥasan al-Shaybānī, was present at the court and defended al-Shāfi‘ī as a well-known student of the sacred law. What was certain was that the incident brought al-Shāfi‘ī in close contact with al-Shaybānī, who would soon become his teacher. It was also postulated that this unfortunate incident impelled him to devote the rest of his career to legal studies, never again to seek government service.

### Apprenticeship under Al-Shaybānī, and exposure to Hanafī Jurists

Al-Shāfi'ī travelled to Baghdad to study with Abu Hanifah's acolyte al-Shaybānī and others. It was here that he developed his first madh'hab, influenced by the teachings of both Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik.

It was here that al-Shāfi'ī actively participated in legal arguments with the Hanafī jurists, strenuously defending the Mālikī school of thought. Some authorities stress the difficulties encountered by him in his arguments. Al-Shāfi'ī eventually left Baghdad for Mecca in 804 CE, possibly because of complaints by Hanafī followers to al-Shaybānī that al-Shafi'i had become somewhat critical of al-Shaybānī's position during their disputes. As a result, al-Shāfi'ī reportedly participated in a debate with al-Shaybānī over their differences, though who won the debate is disputed.

In Mecca, al-Shāfi'ī began to lecture at the Sacred Mosque, leaving a deep impression on many students of law, including the famous Hanbali jurist, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. Al-Shāfi'ī's legal reasoning began to mature, as he started to appreciate the strength in the legal reasoning of the Hanafī jurists, and became aware of the weaknesses inherent in both the Mālikī and Hanafī schools of thought.

### Departure to Baghdad and Egypt

Al-Shāfi'ī eventually returned to Baghdad in 810 CE. By this time, his stature as a jurist had grown sufficiently to permit him to establish an independent line of legal speculation. Caliph al-Ma'mun is said to have offered al-Shāfi'ī a position as a judge, but he declined the offer.

### Connection with the family of Muhammad

In 814 CE, al-Shāfi'ī decided to leave Baghdad for Egypt. The precise reasons for his departure from Iraq are uncertain, but it was in Egypt that he would meet another tutor, Sayyida Nafisa bint Al-Hasan, who would also financially support his studies, and where he would dictate his life's works to students. Several of his leading disciples would write down what al-Shāfi'ī said, who would then have them read it back aloud so that corrections could be made. Al-Shāfi'ī biographers all agree that the legacy of works under his name are the result of those sessions with his disciples.

Nafisa was a descendant of Muhammad, through his grandson Hasan ibn Ali, who married another descendant of Muhammad, that is Ishaq al-Mu'tamin, the son of the Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq, who was reportedly a teacher of ash-Shafi'i's teacher Malik ibn Anas and Abu Hanifah. Thus all of the four great Imams of Sunni Fiqh (Abu Hanifah, Malik, his student Ash-Shafi'i, and his student Ibn Hanbal) are connected to Imam Ja'far from the Bayt (Household) of Muhammad, whether directly or indirectly.

### Legacy

#### Islam, Fiqh, Sunnah

Al-Shāfi'ī is credited with creating the essentials of the science of fiqh (the system of Islamic jurisprudence). He designated the four principles/sources/components of fiqh, which in order of importance are:

1. The Qur’an.
2. Hadith. i.e collections of the words, actions, and silent approval of Muhammad. (Together with the Qur'an these make up "revealed sources".).
3. Ijma. i.e. the consensus of the (pure traditional) Muslim community.  consensus or agreement of the Islamic community on a point of Islamic law.
4. Qiyas. i.e. the method of analogy. Qiyas (Arabic: قياس) is the process of deductive analogy in which the teachings of the hadith are compared and contrasted with those of the Quran, in order to apply a known injunction (nass) to a new circumstance and create a new injunction. 

With this systematisation of shari'a, he provided a legacy of unity for all Muslims and forestalled the development of independent, regionally based legal systems. The four Sunni legal schools or madhhabs keep their traditions within the framework that Shafi'i established. One of the schools – Shafi'i fiqh – is named for Al-Shāfi‘ī. It is followed in many different places in the Islamic world: Indonesia, Malaysia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Somalia, Yemen , west of Iran,as well as Sri Lanka and southern parts of India, especially in the Malabar coast of North Kerala and Canara region of Karnataka.

Al-Shāfi‘ī emphasised the final authority of a hadith of Muhammad so that even the Qur'an was "to be interpreted in the light of traditions (i.e. hadith), and not vice versa." While traditionally the Quran is considered above the Sunna in authority, Al-Shafi'i "forcefully argued" that the sunna stands "on equal footing with the Quran", (according to scholar Daniel Brown) for – as Al-Shafi'i put it – "the command of the Prophet is the command of Almighty Allah ."

Al-Shāfi‘ī "insists time after time that nothing can override the authority of the Prophet, even if it be attested only by an isolate tradition, and that every well-authenticated tradition going back to the Prophet has precedence over the opinions of his Companions, their Successors, and later authorities."

The focus by the Muslim community on ahadith of Muhammad and disinterest in ahadith of Muhammad's companions (whose ahadith were commonly used before Al-Shāfi‘ī since most of whom survived him and spread his teachings after his death) is thought (by scholar Joseph Schacht) to reflect the success of Al-Shāfi‘ī's doctrine.

Al-Shāfi‘ī influence was such that he changed the use of the term Sunnah, "until it invariably meant only the Sunnah of the Prophet" (according to John Burton this was his "principle achievement"). While earlier, sunnah had been used to refer to tribal manners and customs, (and while Al-Shāfi‘ī distinguished between the non-authoritative "sunnah of the Muslims" that was followed in practice, and the "sunnah of the Prophet" that Muslims should follow), sunnah came to mean the Sunnah of Muhammad.

In the Islamic sciences, Burton credits him with "the imposition of a formal theoretical distinction" between `the Sunnah of the Prophet` and the Quran, "especially where the two fundamental sources appeared to clash".

#### Kalam

Al-Shafi'i was part of those early traditionalist theologians who strongly opposed Kalam and criticised the speculative theologians for abandoning the Qur'an and Sunnah through their adoption of Kalam.

#### Books

He authored more than 100 books. But most them have not reached us. The extant works of his which are accessible today are:

* Al-Risala – The best-known book by al-Shafi'i in which he examined principles of jurisprudence. The book has been translated into English.
* Kitab al-Umm – his main surviving text on Shafi'i fiqh
* Musnad al-Shafi'i (on hadith) – it is available with arrangement, Arabic 'Tartib', by Ahmad ibn Abd ar-Rahman al-Banna
* Ikhtilaf al Hadith
* Al sunan al Ma’thour
* Jma’ al ilm

## 780-855: Ahmad ibn Hanbal

</summary>
a hero of the ahl al-hadith

Ahmad ibn Hanbal was a Muslim jurist, theologian, ascetic, hadith traditionist, and founder of the Hanbali school of Sunni jurisprudence — one of the four major orthodox legal schools of Sunni Islam.

A highly influential and active scholar during his lifetime, Ibn Hanbal went on to become "one of the most venerated" intellectual figures in Islamic history, who has had a "profound influence affecting almost every area of" the traditionalist perspective within Sunni Islam. One of the foremost classical proponents of relying on scriptural sources as the basis for Sunni Islamic law and way of life, Ibn Hanbal compiled one of the most important Sunni hadith collections, the Musnad, which has continued to exercise considerable influence in the field of hadith studies up to the present time.

Having studied fiqh and hadith under many teachers during his youth, Ibn Hanbal became famous in his later life for the crucial role he played in the Mihna, the inquisition instituted by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma'mun towards the end of his reign, in which the ruler gave official state support to the Muʿtazilite dogma of the Quran being created, a view that contradicted the orthodox doctrine of the Quran being the eternal, uncreated Word of God. Suffering physical persecution under the caliph for his unflinching adherence to the traditional doctrine, Ibn Hanbal's fortitude in this particular event only bolstered his "resounding reputation" in the annals of Sunni history.

### Education and work

Imam Ahmad studied extensively in Baghdad, and later traveled to further his education. He started learning jurisprudence (Fiqh) under the celebrated Hanafi judge, Abu Yusuf, the renowned student and companion of Imaam Abu Hanifah. After finishing his studies with Abu Yusuf, ibn Hanbal began traveling through Iraq, Syria, and Arabia to collect hadiths, or traditions of the Prophet Muhammad. Ibn al-Jawzi states that Imam Ahmad had 414 Hadith masters whom he narrated from. With this knowledge, he became a leading authority on the hadith, leaving an immense encyclopedia of hadith, Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal. After several years of travel, he returned to Baghdad to study Islamic law under Al-Shafi'i.

Ahmad became a mufti in his old age, and founded the Hanbali madhab, or school of Islamic law, which is now most dominant in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates. Unlike the other three schools of Islamic jurisprudence (Hanafi, Maliki, and Shafi), the Hanbali madhab remained largely traditionalist or Athari in theology.

In addition to his scholastic enterprises, ibn Hanbal was a soldier on the Islamic frontiers (Ribat) and made Hajj five times in his life, twice on foot.

### The Mihna

Ibn Hanbal was known to have been called before the Inquisition or Mihna of the Abbasid Caliph Al-Ma'mun. Al-Ma'mun wanted to assert the religious authority of the Caliph by pressuring scholars to adopt the Mu'tazila view that the Qur'an was created rather than uncreated. According to Sunni tradition, ibn Hanbal was among the scholars to resist the Caliph's interference and the Mu'tazili doctrine of a created Qur'an—although some Orientalist sources raise a question on whether or not he remained steadfast. Ibn Hanbal's stand against the inquisition by the Mu'tazila (who had been the ruling authority at the time) led to the Hanbali school establishing itself firmly as not only a school of fiqh (legal jurisprudence), but of theology as well.

Due to his refusal to accept Mu'tazilite authority, ibn Hanbal was imprisoned in Baghdad throughout the reign of al-Ma'mun. In an incident during the rule of al-Ma'mun's successor, al-Mu'tasim, ibn Hanbal was flogged to unconsciousness. However, this caused upheaval in Baghdad and al-Mu'tasim was forced to release ibn Hanbal. After al-Mu’tasim's death, al-Wathiq became caliph and continued his predecessor's policies of Mu'tazilite enforcement and in this pursuit, he banished ibn Hanbal from Baghdad. It was only after al-Wathiq's death and the ascent of his brother al-Mutawakkil, who was much friendlier to the more traditional Sunni beliefs, that ibn Hanbal was welcomed back to Baghdad.

### Theology

Ibn Hanbal's principal doctrine is what later came to be known as "traditionalist thought," which emphasized the acceptance of only the Quran and hadith as the foundations of orthodox belief. He did, however, believe that it was only a select few who were properly authorized to interpret the sacred texts.

#### The Quran

One of Ibn Hanbal's most famous contributions to Sunni thought was the considerable role he played in bolstering the orthodox doctrine of the Quran being the "uncreated Word of God" (kalām Allāh g̲h̲ayr mak̲h̲lūḳ). By "Quran," Ibn Hanbal understood "not just an abstract idea but the Quran with its letters, words, expressions, and ideas—the Quran in all its living reality, whose nature in itself," according to Ibn Hanbal, eluded human comprehension.

#### Taqlid

Ahmad ibn Hanbal favoured Ijtihad and rejected Taqlid; the practise of blind adherence to madhabs (legal schools). Ahmad ibn Hanbal's staunch condemnation of Taqlid is reported in Hanbali Qadi 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Hassan's treatise (1196-1285 A.H / 1782-1868 C.E) Fath al-Majeed. Comparing Taqlid to Shirk (polytheism), ibn Hanbal states:

"I am amazed at those people who know that a Sanad (i.e. Chain of Transmission) is authentic and yet, in spite of this, they follow the opinion of Sufyan, for Allah (Glorified beHe), says: {And let those who oppose the Messenger's commandment (i.e. his Sunnah - legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them}. (An-Nur: 63) Do you know what that Fitnah is? That Fitnah is Shirk (polytheism). Maybe the rejection of some of his words would cause one to doubt and deviate in his heart and thereby be destroyed."

## Al-Bukhari (810-870)

</summary>

Muhammad ibn Isma'il ibn Ibrahim (محمد ابن اسماعيل ابن ابراهيم, ; 19 July 810 – 1 September 870), better known as al-Bukhari ( البخاری, ), commonly referred to as Imam al-Bukhari or Imam Bukhari, was a Persian Islamic scholar who was born in Bukhara (early Khorasan and present day Uzbekistan). He compiled the hadith collection known as Sahih al-Bukhari, regarded by Sunni Muslims as the most authentic (sahih) hadith collections. He also wrote other books such as Al-Adab al-Mufrad.

Muhammad ibn Ismaʿil al-Bukhari al-Juʿfi was born after the Jumu'ah prayer,13 Shawwal 194 AH in the city of Bukhara in Greater Khorasan (in present-day Uzbekistan).

His father, Ismail ibn Ibrahim, a scholar of hadith, was a student and associate of Malik ibn Anas. Some Iraqi scholars related hadith narrations from him.

## Al-Tabari (839-923)

</summary>
Muhammad ibn Jarir ibn Yazid ( محمد ابن جرير ابن يزيد, ), more commonly known as al-Tabari, or alternatively as Abu Jafar, was an Iranian historian and Islamic scholar from Amol, Tabaristan. Among the most prominent figures of the Islamic Golden Age, al-Tabari is known for his historical works, his expertise in Qur'anic exegesis (tafsir) and Historiography, but he has been described as "an impressively prolific polymath. He wrote on such subjects as world history, poetry, lexicography, grammar, ethics, mathematics, and medicine."

His most influential and best known works are his Qur'anic commentary, known in Arabic as Tafsir al-Tabari, and his historical chronicle History of the Prophets and Kings (Tarikh al-Rusul wa al-Muluk), often referred to Tarikh al-Tabari.

Al-Tabari followed the Shafi'i madhhab for nearly a decade before he developed his own interpretation of Islamic jurisprudence. His understanding of fiqh was both sophisticated and remarkably fluid and, as such, he continued to develop his ideas and thoughts on juristic matters right to the end of his life. Al-Tabari's school of thought (madhhab) flourished among Sunni ulama for two centuries after his death, before it eventually became extinct. It was usually designated by the name Jariri.

## 972: Fatimids build the madrasah of al-Azhar in Cairo

</summary>

The Al-Azhar University (جامعة الأزهر (الشريف), , "the University of (the honorable) Al-Azhar") is a public university in Cairo, Egypt. Associated with Al-Azhar Mosque in Islamic Cairo, it is Egypt's oldest degree-granting university – and the world's second oldest degree granting university – and is renowned as the most prestigious university for Islamic learning. In addition to higher education, Al-Azhar oversees a national network of schools with approximately two million students. As of 1996, over 4,000 teaching institutes in Egypt were affiliated with the university.

Founded in 970 or 972 by the Fatimid Caliphate as a centre of Islamic learning, its students studied the Qur'an and Islamic law in detail, along with logic, grammar, rhetoric, and how to calculate the phases of the moon. Today it is the chief centre of Arabic literature and Islamic learning in the world. In 1961 additional non-religious subjects were added to its curriculum.

Its library is considered second in importance in Egypt only to the Egyptian National Library and Archives. In May 2005, Al-Azhar in partnership with a Dubai information technology enterprise, IT Education Project (ITEP) launched the H.H. Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum project to preserve Al Azhar scripts and publish them online (the "Al-Azhar Online Project") to eventually publish online access to the library's entire rare manuscripts collection, comprising about seven million pages of material.

### Beginnings under the Fatimids

Al-Azhar is one of the relics of the Isma'ili Shi'a Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descent from Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad and wife of Ali son-in-law and cousin of Muhammad. Fatimah was called al-Zahra (the luminous), and the institution was named in her honor. It was founded as a mosque by the Fatimid commander Jawhar al-Siqilli at the orders of the Caliph and Imam Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah as he founded the city for Cairo. It was begun (probably on Saturday) in Jumada al-Awwal in the year AH 359 (March/April 970 CE). Its building was completed on the 9th of Ramadan in the year AH 361 (24 June 972 CE). Both Caliph al-Aziz Billah and Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah added to its premises. It was further repaired, renovated and extended by al-Mustansir Billah and al-Hafiz li-Din Allah. The Fatimid caliphs always encouraged scholars and jurists to have their study-circles and gatherings in this mosque and thus it was turned into a madrasa which has the claim to be considered as the oldest such institution still functioning.

Studies began at Al-Azhar in the month of Ramadan, 975. According to Syed Farid Alatas, the Jami'ah had faculties in Islamic law and jurisprudence, Arabic grammar, Islamic astronomy, Islamic philosophy, and logic. The Fatimids gave attention to the philosophical studies at the time when rulers in other countries declared those who were engaged in philosophical pursuits as apostates and heretics. Greek thought found a warm reception with the Fatimids who expanded the boundaries of such studies. They paid much attention to philosophy and gave support to everyone who was known for being engaged in the study of any branch of philosophy. The Fatimid Caliph invited many scholars from nearby countries and paid much attention to college books on various branches of knowledge and in gathering the finest writing on various subjects and this in order to encourage scholars and to uphold the cause of knowledge. These books were destroyed by Saladin.

### Saladin

In the 12th century, following the overthrow of the Isma'ili Fatimid dynasty, Saladin (the founder of the Sunni Ayyubid Dynasty) converted Al-Azhar to a Shafi'ite Sunni center of learning. Therefore, the Encyclopaedia of Islam (Leiden, 1936, 3rd vol., p. 353) writes that, "He had all the treasures of the palace, including the books, sold over a period of ten years. Many were burned, thrown into the Nile, or thrown into a great heap, which was covered with sand, so that a regular "hill of books" was formed and the soldiers used to sole their shoes with the fine bindings. The number of books said to have disposed of varies from 120,000 to 2,000,000." Abd-el-latif delivered lectures on Islamic medicine at Al-Azhar, while according to legend the Jewish philosopher Maimonides delivered lectures on medicine and astronomy there during the time of Saladin though no historical proof has corroborated this.

Saladin introduced the college system in Egypt, which was also adopted in Al-Azhar. Under this system, the college was a separate institution within the mosque compound, with its own classrooms, dormitories and a library.

## 980-1037 ibn Sina (Avicenna)

</summary>

Ibn Sina (Persian: ابن سینا; 980 – June 1037 CE), commonly known in the West as Avicenna (/ˌævɪˈsɛnə, ˌɑːvɪ-/), was a Persian polymath who is regarded as one of the most significant physicians, astronomers, philosophers, and writers of the Islamic Golden Age, and the father of early modern medicine.Sajjad H. Rizvi has called Avicenna "arguably the most influential philosopher of the pre-modern era". He was a Muslim Peripatetic philosopher influenced by Greek Aristotelian philosophy. Of the 450 works he is believed to have written, around 240 have survived, including 150 on philosophy and 40 on medicine.

His most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650. Besides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's corpus includes writings on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics, and works of poetry.

Avicenna wrote extensively on early Islamic philosophy, especially the subjects logic, ethics and metaphysics, including treatises named Logic and Metaphysics. Most of his works were written in Arabic—then the language of science in the Middle East—and some in Persian. Of linguistic significance even to this day are a few books that he wrote in nearly pure Persian language (particularly the Danishnamah-yi 'Ala', Philosophy for Ala' ad-Dawla'). Avicenna's commentaries on Aristotle often criticized the philosopher,[citation needed] encouraging a lively debate in the spirit of ijtihad.

Avicenna's Neoplatonic scheme of "emanations" became fundamental in the Kalam (school of theological discourse) in the 12th century.

His Book of Healing became available in Europe in partial Latin translation some fifty years after its composition, under the title Sufficientia, and some authors have identified a "Latin Avicennism" as flourishing for some time, paralleling the more influential Latin Averroism, but suppressed by the Parisian decrees of 1210 and 1215.

Avicenna's psychology and theory of knowledge influenced William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris and Albertus Magnus, while his metaphysics influenced the thought of Thomas Aquinas.

### Argument for God's existence

Avicenna made an argument for the existence of God which would be known as the "Proof of the Truthful" (Arabic: burhan al-siddiqin). Avicenna argued that there must be a "necessary existent" (Arabic: wajib al-wujud), an entity that cannot not exist and through a series of arguments, he identified it with the Islamic conception of God. Present-day historian of philosophy Peter Adamson called this argument one of the most influential medieval arguments for God's existence, and Avicenna's biggest contribution to the history of philosophy.

### Theology

Avicenna was a devout Muslim and sought to reconcile rational philosophy with Islamic theology. His aim was to prove the existence of God and His creation of the world scientifically and through reason and logic. Avicenna's views on Islamic theology (and philosophy) were enormously influential, forming part of the core of the curriculum at Islamic religious schools until the 19th century. Avicenna wrote a number of short treatises dealing with Islamic theology. These included treatises on the prophets (whom he viewed as "inspired philosophers"), and also on various scientific and philosophical interpretations of the Quran, such as how Quranic cosmology corresponds to his own philosophical system. In general these treatises linked his philosophical writings to Islamic religious ideas; for example, the body's afterlife.

There are occasional brief hints and allusions in his longer works, however, that Avicenna considered philosophy as the only sensible way to distinguish real prophecy from illusion. He did not state this more clearly because of the political implications of such a theory, if prophecy could be questioned, and also because most of the time he was writing shorter works which concentrated on explaining his theories on philosophy and theology clearly, without digressing to consider epistemological matters which could only be properly considered by other philosophers.

Later interpretations of Avicenna's philosophy split into three different schools; those (such as al-Tusi) who continued to apply his philosophy as a system to interpret later political events and scientific advances; those (such as al-Razi) who considered Avicenna's theological works in isolation from his wider philosophical concerns; and those (such as al-Ghazali) who selectively used parts of his philosophy to support their own attempts to gain greater spiritual insights through a variety of mystical means. It was the theological interpretation championed by those such as al-Razi which eventually came to predominate in the madrasahs.

Avicenna memorized the Quran by the age of ten, and as an adult, he wrote five treatises commenting on suras from the Quran. One of these texts included the Proof of Prophecies, in which he comments on several Quranic verses and holds the Quran in high esteem. Avicenna argued that the Islamic prophets should be considered higher than philosophers.

Avicenna is generally understood to have been aligned with the Sunni Hanafi school of thought. Avicenna studied Hanafi law, many of his notable teachers were Hanafi jurists, and he served under the Hanafi court of Ali ibn Mamun. Avicenna said at an early age that he remained "unconvinced" by Ismaili missionary attempts to convert him.

### The Canon of Medicine

Avicenna authored a five-volume medical encyclopedia: The Canon of Medicine (Al-Qanun fi't-Tibb). It was used as the standard medical textbook in the Islamic world and Europe up to the 18th century. The Canon still plays an important role in Unani medicine.

### Liber Primus Naturalium

Avicenna considered whether events like rare diseases or disorders have natural causes. He used the example of polydactyly to explain his perception that causal reasons exist for all medical events. This view of medical phenomena anticipated developments in the Enlightenment by seven centuries.

### The Book of Healing

The Book of Healing (also known as The Cure or Assepha) is a scientific and philosophical encyclopedia written by Abu Ali ibn Sīna (aka Avicenna) from medieval Persia, near Bukhara in Maverounnahr. He most likely began to compose the book in 1014, completed it around 1020, and published it in 1027.

This work is Ibn Sina's major work on science and philosophy, and is intended to "cure" or "heal" ignorance of the soul. Thus, despite its title, it is not concerned with medicine.

The book is divided into four parts: logic, natural sciences, mathematics (a quadrivium of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy), and metaphysics. It was influenced by ancient Greek philosophers such as Aristotle; Hellenistic thinkers such as Ptolemy; and earlier Persian/Muslim scientists and philosophers, such as Al-Kindi (Alkindus), Al-Farabi (Alfarabi), and Al-Bīrūnī.

### Astronomy and astrology

Skull of Avicenna, found in 1950 during construction of the new mausoleum
Avicenna wrote an attack on astrology titled Resāla fī ebṭāl aḥkām al-nojūm, in which he cited passages from the Quran to dispute the power of astrology to foretell the future. He believed that each planet had some influence on the earth, but argued against astrologers being able to determine the exact effects.

Avicenna's astronomical writings had some influence on later writers, although in general his work could be considered less developed than Alhazen or Al-Biruni. One important feature of his writing is that he considers mathematical astronomy as a separate discipline to astrology. He criticized Aristotle's view of the stars receiving their light from the Sun, stating that the stars are self-luminous, and believed that the planets are also self-luminous. He claimed to have observed Venus as a spot on the Sun. This is possible, as there was a transit on 24 May 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location at that time; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e. the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the prevailing geocentric model.

He also wrote the Summary of the Almagest, (based on Ptolemy's Almagest), with an appended treatise "to bring that which is stated in the Almagest and what is understood from Natural Science into conformity". For example, Avicenna considers the motion of the solar apogee, which Ptolemy had taken to be fixed.

### Chemistry

Avicenna was first to derive the attar of flowers from distillation and used steam distillation to produce essential oils such as rose essence, which he used as aromatherapeutic treatments for heart conditions.

Unlike al-Razi, Avicenna explicitly disputed the theory of the transmutation of substances commonly believed by alchemists:

> Those of the chemical craft know well that no change can be effected in the different species of substances, though they can produce the appearance of such change.

Four works on alchemy attributed to Avicenna were translated into Latin as:

* Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae
* Declaratio Lapis physici Avicennae filio sui Aboali
* Avicennae de congelatione et conglutinatione lapidum
* Avicennae ad Hasan Regem epistola de Re recta

Liber Aboali Abincine de Anima in arte Alchemiae was the most influential, having influenced later medieval chemists and alchemists such as Vincent of Beauvais.

### Legacy

#### Classical Islamic civilization

Robert Wisnovsky, a scholar of Avicenna attached to McGill University, says that "Avicenna was the central figure in the long history of the rational sciences in Islam, particularly in the fields of metaphysics, logic and medicine" but that his works didn't only have an influence in these "secular" fields of knowledge alone, as "these works, or portions of them, were read, taught, copied, commented upon, quoted, paraphrased and cited by thousands of post-Avicennian scholars—not only philosophers, logicians, physicians and specialists in the mathematical or exact sciences, but also by those who specialized in the disciplines of ʿilm al-kalām (rational theology, but understood to include natural philosophy, epistemology and philosophy of mind) and usūl al-fiqh (jurisprudence, but understood to include philosophy of law, dialectic, and philosophy of language)."

#### Middle Ages and Renaissance

Inside view of the Avicenna Mausoleum, designed by Hooshang Seyhoun in 1945–1950
As early as the 14th century when Dante Alighieri depicted him in Limbo alongside the virtuous non-Christian thinkers in his Divine Comedy such as Virgil, Averroes, Homer, Horace, Ovid, Lucan, Socrates, Plato and Saladin. Avicenna has been recognized by both East and West as one of the great figures in intellectual history. Johannes Kepler cites Avicenna's opinion when discussing the causes of planetary motions in Chapter 2 of Astronomia Nova 

George Sarton, the author of The History of Science, described Avicenna as "one of the greatest thinkers and medical scholars in history" and called him "the most famous scientist of Islam and one of the most famous of all races, places, and times". He was one of the Islamic world's leading writers in the field of medicine.

Along with Rhazes, Abulcasis, Ibn al-Nafis and al-Ibadi, Avicenna is considered an important compiler of early Muslim medicine. He is remembered in the Western history of medicine as a major historical figure who made important contributions to medicine and the European Renaissance. His medical texts were unusual in that where controversy existed between Galen and Aristotle's views on medical matters (such as anatomy), he preferred to side with Aristotle, where necessary updating Aristotle's position to take into account post-Aristotelian advances in anatomical knowledge. Aristotle's dominant intellectual influence among medieval European scholars meant that Avicenna's linking of Galen's medical writings with Aristotle's philosophical writings in the Canon of Medicine (along with its comprehensive and logical organisation of knowledge) significantly increased Avicenna's importance in medieval Europe in comparison to other Islamic writers on medicine. His influence following translation of the Canon was such that from the early fourteenth to the mid-sixteenth centuries he was ranked with Hippocrates and Galen as one of the acknowledged authorities, princeps medicorum ("prince of physicians").

He is considered to be the 5th century's Mujaddid, a renewer of the faith, who, according to the prophetic hadith, appears once every 100 years to restore the faith of the Islamic Community. His works were so highly acclaimed by his contemporaries that al-Ghazali was awarded the honorific title "Proof of Islam" (Ḥujjat al-Islām).

Al-Ghazali believed that the Islamic spiritual tradition had become moribund and that the spiritual sciences taught by the first generation of Muslims had been forgotten. This belief led him to write his magnum opus entitled Iḥyā’ ‘ulūm ad-dīn ("The Revival of the Religious Sciences"). Among his other works, the Tahāfut al-Falāsifa ("Incoherence of the Philosophers") is a landmark in the history of philosophy, as it advances the critique of Aristotelian science developed later in 14th-century Europe. 

### Teachings

Al-Ghazali's contemporary and first biographer, 'Abd al-Ghafir al-Farisi, records merely that al-Ghazali began to receive instruction in fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) from Ahmad al-Radhakani, a local teacher and Abu ali Farmadi, a Naqshbandi sufi from Tus.  He later studied under al-Juwayni, the distinguished jurist and theologian and "the most outstanding Muslim scholar of his time," in Nishapur, perhaps after a period of study in Gurgan. After al-Juwayni's death in 1085, al-Ghazali departed from Nishapur and joined the court of Nizam al-Mulk, the powerful vizier of the Seljuq empire, which was likely centered in Isfahan. After bestowing upon him the titles of "Brilliance of the Religion" and "Eminence among the Religious Leaders," Nizam al-Mulk advanced al-Ghazali in July 1091 to the "most prestigious and most challenging" professorial position at the time: the Nizamiyya madrasa in Baghdad.

He underwent a spiritual crisis in 1095, likely suffering from clinical hysteria, abandoned his career and left Baghdad on the pretext of going on pilgrimage to Mecca. Making arrangements for his family, he disposed of his wealth and adopted an ascetic lifestyle. According to biographer Duncan B. Macdonald, the purpose of abstaining from scholastic work was to confront the spiritual experience and more ordinary understanding of "the Word and the Traditions." After some time in Damascus and Jerusalem, with a visit to Medina and Mecca in 1096, he returned to Tus to spend the next several years in 'uzla (seclusion). The seclusion consisted in abstaining from teaching at state-sponsored institutions, but he continued to publish, receive visitors and teach in the zawiya (private madrasa) and khanqah (Sufi lodge) that he had built.

Fakhr al-Mulk, grand vizier to Ahmad Sanjar, pressed al-Ghazali to return to the Nizamiyya in Nishapur. Al-Ghazali reluctantly capitulated in 1106, fearing rightly that he and his teachings would meet with resistance and controversy. He later returned to Tus and declined an invitation in 1110 from the grand vizier of the Seljuq Sultan Muhammad I to return to Baghdad.

### School Affiliaations

Al-Ghazali contributed significantly to the development of a systematic view of Sufism and its integration and acceptance in mainstream Islam. As a scholar of Sunni Islam, he belonged to the Shafi'i school of Islamic jurisprudence and to the Asharite school of theology. Al-Ghazali received many titles such as Sharaf-ul-Aʾimma (شرف الأئمة), Zayn-ud-dīn (زين الدين) and Ḥujjat-ul-Islām (حجة الإسلام).

He is viewed as the key member of the influential Asharite school of early Muslim philosophy and the most important refuter of the Mutazilites. However, he chose a slightly different position in comparison with the Asharites. His beliefs and thoughts differ in some aspects from the orthodox Asharite school.

### Works

A total of about 70 works can be attributed to Al-Ghazali. He is also known to have written a fatwa against the Taifa kings of Al Andalus, declaring them to be unprincipled, not fit to rule and that they should be removed from power. This fatwa was used by Yusuf ibn Tashfin to justify his conquest of al-Andalus 

### Incoherence of the Philosophers

His 11th century book titled The Incoherence of the Philosophers marks a major turn in Islamic epistemology. The encounter with skepticism led al-Ghazali to investigate a form of theological occasionalism, or the belief that all causal events and interactions are not the product of material conjunctions but rather the immediate and present will of God.

In the next century, Averroes drafted a lengthy rebuttal of al-Ghazali's Incoherence entitled The Incoherence of the Incoherence; however, the epistemological course of Islamic thought had already been set. Al-Ghazali gave as an example of the illusion of independent laws of cause the fact that cotton burns when coming into contact with fire. While it might seem as though a natural law was at work, it happened each and every time only because God willed it to happen—the event was "a direct product of divine intervention as any more attention grabbing miracle". Averroes, by contrast insisted while God created the natural law, humans "could more usefully say that fire caused cotton to burn—because creation had a pattern that they could discern."

The Incoherence also marked a turning point in Islamic philosophy in its vehement rejections of Aristotle and Plato. The book took aim at the falasifa, a loosely defined group of Islamic philosophers from the 8th through the 11th centuries (most notable among them Avicenna and Al-Farabi) who drew intellectually upon the Ancient Greeks.

### The Revival of Religious Sciences (Ihya' Ulum al-Din)

Another of al-Ghazali's major works is Ihya' Ulum al-Din or Ihya'u Ulumiddin (The Revival of Religious Sciences). It covers almost all fields of Islamic sciences: fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), kalam (theology) and sufism.

It contains four major sections: Acts of worship (Rub' al-'ibadat), Norms of Daily Life (Rub' al-'adatat), The ways to Perdition (Rub' al-muhlikat) and The Ways to Salvation (Rub' al-munjiyat). The Ihya became the most frequently recited Islamic text after the Qur'an and the hadith. Its great achievement was to bring orthodox Sunni theology and Sufi mysticism together in a useful, comprehensive guide to every aspect of Muslim life and death. The book was well received by Islamic scholars such as Nawawi who stated that: "Were the books of Islam all to be lost, excepting only the Ihya', it would suffice to replace them all."

### The Alchemy of Happiness

*The Alchemy of Happiness* is a rewritten version of *The Revival of the Religious Sciences.* After the existential crisis that caused him to completely re-examine his way of living and his approach to religion, Al-Ghazali put together The Alchemy of Happiness to reassert his fundamental belief that a connection to God was an integral part of the joy of living. The book is divided into four different sections. The first of these is Knowledge of Self, where Al-Ghazali asserts that while food, sex, and other indulgences might slake humans appetites temporarily, they in turn make a human into an animal, and therefore will never give true happiness and fulfillment. In order to find oneself, people must devote themselves to God by showing restraint and discipline rather than gluttony of the senses*.* The second installment is called Knowledge of God, where Al-Ghazali states that the events that occur during one's life are meant to point an individual towards God, and that God will always be strong, no matter how far humans deviate from His will. The third section of *[The Alchemy of Happiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alchemy_of_Happiness "The Alchemy of Happiness")* is Knowledge of the World. Here he states that the world is merely a place where humans learn to love God, and prepare for the future, or the afterlife, the nature of which will be determined by our actions in this phase of our journey to happiness. The final section is Knowledge of the Future World, which details how there are two types of spirits within a man: the angelic spirit and the animal spirit. Al-Ghazali details the types of spiritual tortures unbelievers experience, as well as the path that must be taken in order to attain spiritual enlightenment. This book serves as a culmination of the transformation Ghazali goes through during his spiritual awakening.

### Disciplining the Soul

One of the key sections of Ghazali's Revival of the Religious Sciences is Disciplining the Soul, which focuses on the internal struggles that every Muslim will face over the course of his lifetime. The first chapter primarily focuses on how one can develop himself into a person with positive attributes and good personal characteristics . The second chapter has a more specific focus: sexual satisfaction and gluttony. Here, Ghazali states that indeed every man has these desires and needs, and that it is natural to want these things. However, the Prophet explicitly states that there must be a middle ground for man, in order to practice the tenets of Islam faithfully. The ultimate goal that Ghazali is presenting not only in these two chapters, but in the entirety of The Revival of the Religious Sciences, is that there must be moderation in every aspect of the soul of a man, an equilibrium. These two chapters were the 22nd and 23rd chapters, respectively, in Ghazali's Revival of the Religious Sciences. It's also important to note here that Ghazali draws from Greek as well as Islamic philosophy in crafting this literary staple, even though much of The Incoherence of the Philosophers, his most well known work, takes a critical aim at their perspective.


### The Eternity of the World

Al-Ghazali crafted his rebuttal of the Aristotelian viewpoint on the creation of the world in The Eternity of the World. Al-Ghazali essentially formulates two main arguments for what he views as a sacrilegious thought process. Central to the Aristotelian approach is the concept that motion will always precede motion, or in other words, a force will always create another force, and therefore for a force to be created, another force must act upon that force. This means that in essence time stretches infinitely both into the future and into the past, which therefore proves that God did not create the universe at one specific point in time. Ghazali counters this by first stating that if the world was created with exact boundaries, then in its current form there would be no need for a time before the creation of the world by God. The second argument Ghazali makes is that because humans can only imagine the time before the creation of the world, and your imagination is a fictional thing, that all the time before the world was created is fictional as well, and therefore does not matter as it was not intended by God to be understood by humans.

### The Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief

Al-Ghazali lays out in The Decisive Criterion for Distinguishing Islam from Clandestine Unbelief his approach to Muslim orthodoxy. Ghazali veers from the often hardline stance of many of his contemporaries during this time period and states that as long as one believes in the Prophet Muhammad and God himself, there are many different ways to practice Islam and that any of the many traditions practiced in good faith by believers should not be viewed as heretical by other Muslims. While Ghazali does state that any Muslim practicing Islam in good faith is not guilty of apostasy, he does outline in The Criterion that there is one standard of Islam that is more correct than the others, and that those practicing the faith incorrectly should be moved to change. In Ghazali's view, only the Prophet himself could deem a faithfully practicing Muslim an infidel, and his work was a reaction to the religious persecution and strife that occurred often during this time period between various Islamic sects.

### Works in Persian

Al-Ghazali wrote most of his works in Arabic and few in Persian. His most important Persian work is Kimiya-yi sa'adat (The Alchemy of Happiness). It is al-Ghazali's own Persian version of Ihya' 'ulum al-din (The Revival of Religious Sciences) in Arabic, but a shorter work. It is one of the outstanding works of 11th-century-Persian literature. The book was published several times in Tehran by the edition of Hussain Khadev-jam, a renowned Iranian scholar. It is translated to English, Arabic, Turkish, Urdu, Azerbaijani and other languages.

### Influence

During his life, he wrote over 70 books on science, Islamic reasoning and Sufism. Al-Ghazali distributed his book The Incoherence of Philosophers, set apart as the defining moment in Islamic epistemology. The experience that he had with suspicion drove al-Ghazali to shape a conviction that all occasions and connections are not the result of material conjunctions but are the present and prompt will of God.

Al-Ghazali likewise assumed a noteworthy part in spreading Sufism and Sharia. He was the first to consolidate the ideas of Sufism into Sharia laws and the first to give a formal depiction of Sufism in his works. His works fortify the position of Sunni Islam, contrasted with different schools of thought.

Al-Ghazali had an important influence on both later Muslim philosophers and Christian medieval philosophers. Margaret Smith writes in her book Al-Ghazali: The Mystic (London 1944): "There can be no doubt that al-Ghazali’s works would be among the first to attract the attention of these European scholars" (page 220). Then she emphasizes, "The greatest of these Christian writers who was influenced by al-Ghazali was St. Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274).

The period following Ghazali "has tentatively been called the Golden Age of Arabic philosophy" initiated by Ghazali's successful integration of logic into the Islamic seminary Madrasah curriculum.

Al-Ghazali also played a major role in integrating Sufism with Shariah. He was also the first to present a formal description of Sufism in his works. His works also strengthened the status of Sunni Islam against other schools. The Batinite (Ismailism) had emerged in Persian territories and were gaining more and more power during al-Ghazali's period, as Nizam al-Mulk was assassinated by the members of Ismailis. In his Fada'ih al-Batiniyya (The Infamies of the Esotericists) Al-Ghazali declared them unbelievers whose blood may be spilled, and wrote several books on criticism of Baatinyas which significantly weakened their status.

Al-Ghazali succeeded in gaining widespread acceptance for Sufism at the expense of philosophy. At the same time, in his refutation of philosophers he made use of their philosophical categories and thus helped to give them wider circulation.

Early childhood development was a central focal point of Al-Ghazali. He worked to influence and develop a program to mold the young minds of children at an early age to develop their mind and character. He stressed that socialization, family, and schools were central in the achievement of language, morality, and behavior. He emphasized incorporating physical fitness such as games that were important in the development of young minds to attract the idea of attending schools and maintaining an education. In addition, he stressed the importance of understanding and sharing cultures in the classrooms to achieve a civic harmony that would be expressed outside the classroom and kindness to one another.

In his writings he placed this responsibility upon the teachers. His treatise on early education centered on Islamic laws, God, and memorizing the Qur'an to achieve literary skill. Ghazali emphasized the importance that there should be a dual respect in regard to the teacher and the pupil. Whereas the teacher guides the student and takes the role of a father figure and offers council to the student, and the student respects the teacher as a patriarch. He stressed that the teacher needed to pay attention to the learning paces of his students so that he could help them be successful in academic achievements.[citation needed]

Al-Ghazali was by every indication of his writings a true mystic in the Persian sense. He believed himself to be more mystical or religious than he was philosophical however, he is more widely regarded by some scholars as a leading figure of Islamic philosophy and thought. He describes his philosophical approach as a seeker of true knowledge, a deeper understanding of the philosophical and scientific, and a better understanding of mysticism and cognition.

In the contemporary world, Al-Ghazali is renowned not only for his contribution to Sufism, Islam, philosophy, or education but his work and ethical approach transcends another boundary into the Islamic business practice. In the Journal of Business Ethics, authors Yusif Sidani and Akram Al Ariss explain how Islamic business ethics are governed by the writings of Abu-Hamid Al-Ghazali and even posit that Al-Ghazali is the greatest Muslim since the prophet Muhammad. Traditional Islamist's are influenced by Ghazali's writings since he was indebted to writing about and incorporating Sharia Law. They emphasize, "His mastery of philosophical logic and reasoning earned him the title of philosopher without losing his status as a religious scholar." Al-Ghazili's reasoning on the use of intellect in combination with the rational and spiritual is an integral part of Muslim society today. Therefore, they approach the business perspective with the same ideology and organizational thought.

## House of Wisdom

</summary>

The House of Wisdom (بيت الحكمة, ), also known as the Grand Library of Baghdad, refers to either a major Abbasid public academy and intellectual center in Baghdad or to a large private library belonging to the Abbasid Caliphs during the Islamic Golden Age. The House of Wisdom was founded either as a library for the collections of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid in the late 8th century (then later turned into a public academy during the reign of Al-Ma'mun) or was a private collection created by Al-Mansur (reign 754–775) to house rare books and collections of poetry in Arabic.

The House of Wisdom and its contents were destroyed in the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, leaving relatively limited archaeological evidence for the House of Wisdom, such that most knowledge about it is derived from the works of contemporary scholars of the era such as Al-Tabari and Ibn al-Nadim.

## 1328: Ahmad ibn Taymiyyah in Damascus

</summary>

Ibn Taymiyyah (January 22, 1263 – September 26, 1328; Arabic: ابن تيمية),  Taqī ad-Dīn ʾAḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Ḥalīm ibn ʿAbd al-Salām al-Numayrī al-Ḥarrānī), was a Sunni ʿĀlim, muhaddith, judge, philosopher, and sometimes controversial thinker and political figure. He is known for his diplomatic involvement with the Ilkhanid ruler Ghazan Khan and for his involvement at the Battle of Marj al-Saffar which ended the Mongol invasions of the Levant. A member of the Hanbali school, Ibn Taymiyyah's iconoclastic views that condemned numerous folk practices associated with saint veneration and the visitation of tomb-shrines; made him unpopular with many scholars and rulers of the time, and he was imprisoned several times.

A polarising figure in his own times and in the centuries that followed, Ibn Taymiyyah has emerged as one of the most influential medieval writers in contemporary Sunni Islam. He was also noteworthy for engaging in intense religious polemics that defended Athari school against the followers of rival schools of Kalam (speculative theology); namely Ash'arism and Maturidism. This would prompt numerous clerics and state authorities to accuse Ibn Taymiyyah and his disciples of being guilty of "tashbīh" (anthropomorphism); which eventually led to the censoring of his works and subsequent incarceration. Nevertheless, Ibn Taymiyya's numerous treatises that advocated "creedal Salafism" (al-salafiyya al-iʿtiqādīyya), based on his particular interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah, constitute the most popular classical reference for later Salafi movements.

Ibn Taymiyyah had a simple life, most of which he dedicated to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor did he have a female companion throughout his years. Al-Matroudi says that this may be why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a judge. An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted. His life was that of a religious scholar and a political activist. In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six occasions with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years. Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison. His detentions were due to certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues. However, according to Yahya Michot, "the real reasons were more trivial". Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the "doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues."

Ibn Taymiyyah's attitude towards his own rulers was based on the actions of Muhammad's companions when they made an oath of allegiance to him as follows; "to obey within obedience to God, even if the one giving the order is unjust; to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it; and to speak out the truth, or take up its cause without fear in respect of God, of blame from anyone."

### Education

In 1269, aged seven, Ibn Taymiyyah, left Harran together with his father and three brothers. The city was completely destroyed by the ensuing Mongol invasion. Ibn Taymiyyah's family moved and settled in Damascus, Syria, which at the time was ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate.

In Damascus, his father served as the director of the Sukkariyya Madrasa, a place where Ibn Taymiyyah also received his early education.[46] Ibn Taymiyyah acquainted himself with the religious and secular sciences of his time. His religious studies began in his early teens, when he committed the entire Qur'an to memory and later on came to learn the Islamic disciplines of the Qur'an. From his father he learnt the religious science of fiqh (jurisprudence) and usul al-fiqh (principles of jurisprudence). Ibn Taymiyyah learnt the works of Ahmad ibn Hanbal, al-Khallal, Ibn Qudamah and also the works of his grandfather, Abu al-Barakat Majd ad-Din. His study of jurisprudence was not limited to the Hanbali tradition but he also learnt the other schools of jurisprudence.

The number of scholars under which he studied hadith is said to number more than two hundred, four of whom were women. Those who are known by name amount to forty hadith teachers, as recorded by Ibn Taymiyyah in his book called Arbaun Hadithan. Serajul Haque says, based on this, Ibn Taymiyyah started to hear hadith from the age of five. One of his teachers was the first Hanbali Chief Justice of Syria, Shams ud-Din Al-Maqdisi who held the newly created position instituted by Baibars as part of a reform of the judiciary. Al-Maqdisi later on, came to give Ibn Taymiyyah permission to issue Fatawa (legal verdicts) when he became a mufti at the age of 17.

Ibn Taymiyyah's secular studies led him to devote attention to Arabic language and Arabic literature by studying Arabic grammar and lexicography under Ali ibn Abd al-Qawi al-Tufi. He went on to master the famous book of Arabic grammar, Al-Kitab, by the Persian grammarian Sibawayhi. He also studied mathematics, algebra, calligraphy, theology (kalam), philosophy, history and heresiography. Based on the knowledge he gained from history and philosophy, he used to refute the prevalent philosophical discourses of his time, one of which was Aristotelian philosophy. Ibn Taymiyyah learnt about Sufism and stated that he had reflected on the works of; Sahl al-Tustari, Junayd of Baghdad, Abu Talib al-Makki, Abdul-Qadir Gilani, Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi and Ibn Arabi. At the age of 20 in the year 1282, Ibn Taymiyyah completed his education.

### Life as a scholar

Umayyad Mosque, a place where Ibn Taimiyya used to give lessons.
After his father died in 1284, he took up the then vacant post as the head of the Sukkariyya madrasa and began giving lessons on Hadith. A year later he started giving lessons, as chair of the Hanbali Zawiya on Fridays at the Umayyad Mosque, on the subject of tafsir (exegesis of Qur'an). In November 1292, Ibn Taymiyyah performed the Hajj and after returning 4 months later, he wrote his first book aged twenty nine called Manasik al-Hajj (Rites of the Pilgrimage), in which he criticized and condemned the religious innovations he saw take place there. Ibn Taymiyyah represented the Hanbali school of thought during this time. The Hanbali school was seen as the most traditional school out of the four legal systems (Hanafi, Maliki and Shafii) because it was "suspicious of the Hellenist disciplines of philosophy and speculative theology." 

He remained faithful throughout his life to this school, whose doctrines he had mastered, but he nevertheless called for ijtihad (independent reasoning by one who is qualified) and discouraged <span class="tooltip">taqlid<span class="tooltiptext">Taqlid is an Islamic term denoting the conformity of one person to the teaching of another. In contemporary Sunni usage, it is often portrayed in a negative light and translated as "blind imitation". This refers to the perceived stagnation of independent intellectual effort (ijtihad) and uncritical imitation of traditional religious interpretation by the religious establishment in general.</span>

He spent his last fifteen years in Damascus. Aged 50, Ibn Taymiyyah returned to Damascus via Jerusalem on 28 February 1313. Damascus was now under the governorship of Tankiz. There, Ibn Taymiyyah continued his teaching role as professor of Hanbali fiqh. This is when he taught his most famous student, Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya, who went on to become a noted scholar in Islamic history. Ibn Qayyim was to share in Ibn Taymiyyah's renewed persecution.

Several of Ibn Taymiyyah's students became scholars in their own right. His students came from different backgrounds and belonged to various different schools (madhabs). His most famous students were Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya and Ibn Kathir.

### Legacy

In the 21st century, Ibn Taymiyya is one of the most cited medieval authors and his treatises are regarded to be of central intellectual importance by several Islamic revivalist movements. Ibn Taymiyya's disciples, consisting of both Hanbalis and non-Hanbalis, were attracted to his advocacy of Ijtihad outside the established boundaries of the madhabs and shared his taste for activism and religious reform. Some of his unorthodox legal views in the field of Fiqh were also regarded as a challenge by mainstream Fuqaha.

In the pre-modern era, Ibn Taymiyyah was considered a controversial figure within Sunni Islam and had a number of critics during his life and in the centuries thereafter. The Shafi'i scholar Ibn Hajar al-Haytami stated that,

"Make sure you do not listen to what is in the books of Ibn Taymiyya and his student Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya and other such people who have taken their own whim as their God, and who have been led astray by God, and whose hearts and ears have been sealed, and whose eyes have been covered by Him... May God forsake the one who follows them, and purify the earth of their likes."

The reputation and stature of Ibn Taymiyya amongst non-Ḥanbalī Sunni scholars would significantly improve between the eighteenth and twentieth centuries. From a little-read scholar considered controversial by many, he would become one of the most popular scholarly figures in the Sunni religious tradition.

Ibn Taymiyya's rejection of some aspects of classical Islamic tradition are believed to have had considerable influence on contemporary militant Islamist movements such as Salafi-Jihadism. Major aspects of his teachings such as upholding the pristine monotheism of the early Muslim generations and campaigns to uproot what he regarded as shirk (idolatry); had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Hanbali reform movement practiced in Saudi Arabia, and on other later Sunni scholars. Syrian Salafi theologian Muhammad Rashid Rida (d. 1935 C.E/ 1354 A.H), one of the major modern proponents of his works, designated Ibn Taymiyya as the Mujaddid (renewer) of the Islamic 7th century of Hijri year. Ibn Taymiyyah's doctrinal positions on the necessity of an Islamic political entity and his controversial fatwas, such as his Takfir (declaration of unbelief) of the Mongol Ilkhanates, allowing jihad against other self-professed Muslims, are referenced by al-Qaeda and other jihadist groups to justify militant overthrowal of contemporary governments of the Muslim world.

## 1552: The Russians conquer Kazan and Volzhsk Bulgaria

</summary>

During the existence of the khanate (1438-1552) Russian forces besieged Kazan at least ten times (1469, 1478, 1487, 1506, 1524, 1530, 1545, 1547, 1549-1550, 1552). In 1547 and in 1549-1550, Ivan the Terrible besieged Kazan, but supply difficulties forced him to withdraw. The Russians pulled back 29 kilometres (18 mi) and built the town or fort of Sviyazhsk. They also annexed land west of the Volga which weakened the khanate. The peace party agreed to accept the pro-Russian Shah Ali as khan. The patriotic party regained power, Shah Ali fled and Yadegar Mokhammad of Kazan was called in as khan. Religious leaders like Qolsharif inspired the people to a determined resistance.

The siege of Kazan in 1552 was the final battle of the Russo-Kazan Wars and led to the fall of the Khanate of Kazan. Conflict continued after the fall of Kazan, however, as rebel governments formed in Çalım and Mişätamaq, and a new khan was invited from the Nogais. This guerrilla war lingered until 1556.

The tsarist administration prohibited the Tatars, Chuvash and Mari from settling along rivers and in cities, and also from engaging in blacksmith and jewelry crafts. Settlements in the specified zone were destroyed or relocated.

After his conquest of Kazan, Ivan IV is said to have ordered the crescent, a symbol of Islam, to be placed underneath the Christian cross on the domes of Orthodox Christian churches.

Later in history of Tatars, several occasions of forceful Christianization occured followed by Soviet Union that prohibited any religion.

## The World in General

</summary>

In Islam, the arrival of Judgement Day is prophesied in various ḥadīth collections to be preceded by "signs" or portents of its arrival. These signs tend to fall into disruptions in the order of human morality (music, wine drinking, usury, fornication, homosexuality, and disobedience by wives, senseless murders, lying and cheating, disinterest in and ignorance of religion) and the natural world (frequent unexpected deaths, excessive lightning, destructive rainfall, terrible drought, a huge cloud of smoke, the opening up of huge cracks in the earth -- khasf -- to swallow masses of people alive, the sun rising in the west, poisonous winds that kill all the faithful);
include the appearance of wicked forces such as the AntiChrist figure al-Dajjāl, Gog and Magog, and Sufyani. but also savior(s) the Mahdi and Jesus, who along with divine intervention, will restore order and crush the
The signs may be divided into "minor" signs (these happen first), or "major" signs. (scholars agree there are ten of these but not what they are). They may also be divided into signs that have already happened, are currently happening, or have yet to happen.

Savior and evil-doing figures that appear in the major signs include:

Al-Masih ad-Dajjal (Arabic: المسيح الدجّال, romanized: al-Masīḥ ad-Dajjāl, lit. 'Deceitful Messiah'), is blind in one eye, and will deceive starving masses -- especially the Jews -- by performing miracles. He will raise an army that will kill and conquer, and corner his nemesis, the Mahdi, along with a small army of Muslim fighters in Jerusalem. Jesus will descend from heaven just in time to kill him and defeat his army.

The Mahdi (Arabic: ٱلْمَهْدِيّ, romanized: al-mahdīy), i.e. the "Rightly Guided One", is a messianic figure descended from Muhammad through Ali, who (with the help of Jesus) will defeat the Dajjal, reestablish Islamic law, rid the world of bid'a (religious innovation), and fill it with justice;

Jesus (Arabic: عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ, romanized: ʿĪsā ibn Maryam, lit. 'Isa, son of Maryam') will make a second coming, descending to earth, but unlike in Christianity it will be to assist the Mahdi by killing the dajjal, "break[ing] the cross, kill[ing] the pigs, and abolish[ing] the Jizya tax", i.e. put an end to Christians misconceptions about his being the Son of God and there being no need to follow dietary laws. Jesus and the Mahdi will then rule the earth in perfect justice for a time before Judgement Day. (Shia believe it is the Mahdi who will kill the dajjal; others believe "the Mahdi" is not a distinct person but just the title given to Jesus.)

Gog and Magog (Arabic: يأجوج ومأجوج) are mentioned in the Quran as doing "great mischief on earth", and being suppressed by a figure called Dhul-Qarnayn ("the two-horned one") who builds a wall to contain their mischief, warning their local victims that when the time comes (believed to mean the end times), Allah will remove the barrier. Non-Quranic Islamic apocalyptic literature describes Gog and Magog as a subhuman pestilence who are released from thousands of years of imprisonment to do much killing, pillaging and devouring of vast resources until being wiped out after "God commands an insect or worm to burrow into their necks and kill them".

The Sufyani (Arabic: سفیاني) is a tyrant whose career of murdering innocent women and children will be cut short when he and his army are swallowed up by the earth on their way to seize and kill the Mahdi.

### 12.2 Major Signs of Al Kiyamah

<details><summary>

## Overview

</summary>

According to the Prophet (PBUH), there are 10 major signs that will precede the last Hour and will announce of the finality of the Day of Reckoning. These 10 signs are explained in the following hadith:

Muslim narrated that Hudhayfah ibn Aseed al-Ghifaari (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) came out to us when we were discussing. He said: “What are you discussing?” They said: “We are talking about the Hour.” He said: “It will never begin until you see ten signs before it.” He mentioned the smoke, the Dajjaal, the Beast, the rising of the sun from its place of setting, the descent of ‘Eesa ibn Maryam (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), Ya’jooj and Ma’jooj, and three landslides, one in the east, one in the west and one in the Arabian Peninsula, and the last of that is a fire which will emerge from Yemen and drive the people to their place of gathering (Sahih Muslim, Book 041: 6931)

</details><details><summary>

## Dajjal - the false Messiah or Anti-Christ

</summary> 

One of Dajjal's eyes will be like a bad grape.
one third of the earth for one year the rain will stop. on the second year 2/3 will be rainless.
Dajjal will pretent that he can resurrect people from the dead but it will be jinns who will imitate people's parents.

Dajjal will be the biggest trial for humankind since they were sent to the Earth. 

In Daniel 8:23-26, Daniel sees a vision of a ram the horns of which grow up to the skies an he doesn't know the interpretation of this vision. So then he sees a man llike looking figure and hears: "Gabriel, tell him the meaning of the vision". Gabriel explains to Daniel that in the latter part of their reign when rebels have become completely wicked, a fierce-looking king, a master of intrigue will arise. He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy those who are mighty, the holy priests. He will cause deceit to prosper, and he will consider himself superior. 
Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.
The vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true, but seal up the vision, for it concerns the distant future.

Gabriel had such strong impact on Daniel that he had to recover several days.

</details><details><summary>

## Gog and Magog (Yadjuj and Madjuj)

</summary>

Two chapters of the Quran, Al Kahf and Al-Anbiya, discuss Gog and Magog. In the Quran Yajuj and Majuj (Gog and Magog) are suppressed by Dhul-Qarnayn "the two-horned one." Dhul-Qarnayn, having journeyed to the ends of the world, meets "a people who scarcely understood a word" who seek his help in building a barrier that will separate them from the people of Yajuj and Majuj who "do great mischief on earth". He agrees to build it for them, but warns that when the time comes (Last Age), Allah will remove the barrier.

Quran states that in the past there were some nations Yajuj and Majuj that were doing mischief and Dhul Karnayn helped to build some gate in order to protect some nation. Some scholars hold the opinion that Yajuj and Majuj are not literally behind the wall in the current times.
at some point at time people who have these characteristics or descendands of them will be let loose. 

According to Sahih Muslim, the Prophet said:

> Then a people whom Allah had protected from him (dajjal) would come to Isa, son of Maryam, and he would wipe their faces and would inform them of their ranks in Paradise and it would be under such conditions that Allah would reveal to Isa (alaihis salam) these words: I have brought forth from amongst My servants such people against whom none would be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah would send Gog and Magog and they would swarm down from every slope. The first of them would pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it. And when the last of them would pass, he would say: There was once water there.

## Isa will return to the Earth and defeat Dajjal

</summary>

Isa will die in Medina. and later Medina would be destroyed. no Muslims will be left there.
The Quran will be lifted up.
 Later there will be a ruler from Abyssinia, who will destroy the Kaaba.
while believers would march to figt the Abyssinain ruler, Allah will send a light breeze that will take away the souls of all believers. and only unbelievers will be left on the Earth and they will live like animals.

everything in ad-dunya is cursed except the remembrance of Allah and whoever are the allies of the remembrance of Allah.

While the Mahdī is ruling as the Imām or Khalīfah of the Muslims, and preparing for battle against the forces of the Dajjāl in Syria, shortly after having conquered Constantinople, ʿĪsā b. Maryam (AS) will return to earth. He will descend close to the white minaret to the east of Damascus just before Fajr time.

The Mahdī and others will ask him to lead them in prayer but he will refuse saying, ‘Your Imām should lead, as a grace from Allāh.’”

After they have prayed Fajr, the Muslims will go out to face him; this will be the final battle fought between them and the armies of the Dajjāl. The very fragrance of the breath of ʿĪsā will kill any disbeliever it reaches, and it will extend out for as far as the eye can see. The battle will be so fierce that the forces of the Dajjāl will flee and hide behind boulders and trees, but those boulders and trees themselves will cry out, ‘Muslims, there is a Jew behind me, come kill him!’ except for the Gharqad tree because that is a tree of the Jews.

As soon as the Dajjāl sees ʿĪsa (AS), he will start to dissolve just like salt dissolves in water and run away. ʿĪsā (AS) will pursue him and kill the Dajjāl with his lance at the gate of a place called Ludd (near Tel Aviv, in today’s Israel). He will show the blood on his lance to those around him, proving conclusively that he was just a human being and in no way divine.

He will be a judge, fair and even-handed. He will break the cross, literally and symbolically proving once and for all the falsehood of Christianity; destroying their symbol. He will abolish the jizya, and kill all swine.

Wealth will become abundant, flowing so copiously throughout the lands that there will be none to accept it if offered in charity, even the most valuable camels will be left untended because people are just not concerned about their worth anymore. At that time a single prostration will be worth more than the earth and all that it contains. Abū Hurayrah, after quoting this ḥadīth, commented, ‘Recite if you want,

وَإِن مِّنْ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابِ إِلَّا لَيُؤْمِنَنَّ بِهِ قَبْلَ مَوْتِهِ ۖ وَيَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ يَكُونُ عَلَيْهِمْ شَهِيدًا

There is not one of the People of the Book who will not believe in him before his death, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them.’

He added, ‘Meaning that they will believe in him before he dies.’

He will call the people to Islām and during his time, Allāh will end all religions except Islām. Safety will fill the earth, so much so that the lions will mingle with camels, tigers with cattle and wolves with sheep. Children will play with snakes, and they will not harm them, the sting or poison of every such animal will have been taken away. Rancour, hatred and envy will disappear for a time.

After the Yaʾjūj and Maʾjūj (discussed next) are killed, the time of Jihād will have ended, and so swords will be taken as scythes, the sky will bring down rain, the earth will freely grow its produce and people will take to tilling the land.

ʿĪsā (AS) will perform Ḥajj or ʿUmrah, saying the talbiyah from Rawḥāʾ (a place on the way to Mecca from Medina).

eople will flee in terror, barricading themselves and their livestock in cities and fortresses. Once all the people have fled, and Yaʾjūj and Maʾjūj reach Bayt al-Maqdis, they will say, ‘This is the people of earth sorted.’ They will then shoot arrows and spears into the sky which will fall back down covered in blood, and they will claim that they have killed the inhabitants of the heaven.

ʿĪsā and his companions will withdraw to Mount Ṭūr after Allāh tells them that they have no hope of defeating Yaʾjūj and Maʾjūj and there, they will be besieged; food will become so scarce that the head of an ox would be dearer to them than one hundred dīnārs.

ʿĪsā and his companions will make duʿā to Allāh and eventually Allāh will send a type of worm to the back of their necks which will kill them, and they will die like locusts piled one on top of the other. The Muslims will awake the next day and hear no sound from them and so send one of their own to investigate what has happened. He will return and give them the glad tidings that the enemy has died. The Muslims will then leave and find that there is not even a hand span of land that is free of their corpses. They will let loose their animals to graze, but having nothing to eat, they will instead grow fat on their flesh, as if they were grazing on the best vegetation they ever found. The earth will fill with the stench of their rotting corpses, and ʿĪsā will again make duʿā for relief. Allāh will send birds with necks like the necks of Bactrian camels, which will pick them up and throw them wherever He wills. Then Allāh will send down rain that will wash them away into the sea, and clean house and earth until it is left like a smooth rock or mirror. Then it will be said to the earth, ‘Bring forth your fruits and bring back your blessings.’ On that day a group of people will eat from a (single) pomegranate and it will suffice them, and they will seek shelter beneath its skin. Allah will bless a milk-camel so that it will be sufficient for a large number of people, and a milk-cow will be sufficient for a whole tribe and a milk-ewe will be sufficient for a whole clan.

The time of war will have come to an end,[64] and the Muslims will use the shields, bows and arrows of the Yaʾjūj and Maʿjūj as firewood for seven years. And they will once again make Ḥajj and ʿUmrah at the Kaʿbah.

ʿĪsā (AS) Passes Away

ʿĪsā (AS) will remain on earth for forty years after killing the Dajjāl and then pass away. The Muslims will offer the funeral prayer for him, and bury him.

## The Smoke (Ad-Dukhan)

</summary> 

The Day of Judgement will not take place until you experience Ad Dukhaw. a smoke that will appear in the sky. you will see it, you will feel it. some hadiths say "dark smoke". it will come into everyone. Smoke will come upon the believers like a flu or cold. and it will come upon non-believers causing disaster death, severe ilness and loding consciousness.

The Smoke is mentioned in the Quran.

    "Then wait for the Day when the sky will bring a visible smoke, covering the people; this is a painful torment. [They will say], “Our Lord, remove from us the torment; indeed, we are believers.” How can they be reminded when a messenger has already come to them, making things clear."
    Quran surah Ad Dukhan

### Sun will come up from the West 🌄

</summary> 

and since then, the repentance will not be anymore accepted.

</details><details><summary>

## The Beast appears on the Earth

</summary> 

The Beast will come out at that time. and it will leave marks on people as believer or non-believer.

The Beast of the Earth (Arabic: دَابَّة الأَرْض, romanized: Dābbat al-Arḍ), in Islamic eschatology, will be one of the signs of the coming of the Last Day. It will appear before or after the sun rises in the west, where the Beast will be sighted for the very first time. The Beast is mentioned in the Quran (in Sura An-Naml) and is also mentioned in the ahadith, which expand upon the characteristics of the beast. Islamic tradition holds that the Beast will precipitate the death of all true believers and the removal of the Quran from the world. The Qur'an mentions that the Beast will address the unbelievers and admonish them for their lack of attention towards God:

    And when the Word is fulfilled against them (the unjust), we shall produce from the earth a beast to (face) them: He will speak to them, for that mankind did not believe with assurance in Our Signs.
    Quran 27:82

Some ahadith say that the Beast will be one of the first major signs of the Last Day, along with the sun rising in the west.

### 12.3 Al Qiyamah (The Hereafter)
*******************************************

<details><summary>

### What happens after The End

</summary> 
Allahu 'Alim.

There is no explicit order of events in the Quran and Sunna.

As Saffaranini said there will be 8 things:
* Resurrection (Al Baghf)
* Coming out of the grave and running aroung (An Nushurr)
* The gathering (Al Hashshar)
* Al Quyama -- The standing up
* The showing of the deeds (Al Ard)
* The judgement on the left and right side (Hisab)
* The Scales (Al Mizan)

He didn't mention that Allah and angels will come in rows, the blowing of the trumpet, Shafagha, seeing of Allah, The Cistern (the pool), Sirat, Wurud, The Qantara (open area in front of Jannah).

</details><details><summary>

## Death. What happens when people die

</summary>

Before talking about the Hereafter, we must contemplate on what happens after a person dies.

People who die end up in the Barzak. It is the world of souls where they wait for their resurrection and the Final Judjement. Barzakh (برزخ,  "limbo, barrier, partition" is an Arabic word meaning "obstacle", "hindrance", "separation", or "barrier") in Islam designates a place separating the living from the hereafter or a phase/"stage" between an individual's death and their resurrection in "the Hereafter".

What happens during and after death? 

1. At the moment of death, the veil is removed from a person and this person starts to see the unseen.
2. Two angels come to the person and separate his soul from the body. The appearence of the angels is different: for good people, the angels descent with bright faces; for bad people, the angels have a scary appearence.
3. Angels take the soul of a person to Heavens, where he is dressed up and fragnanced according to his deeds.
4. Soul is sent back to earth to the person's body.
5. In the grave, two angels Munkar and Nakir with unknown appearence come to the soul and ask the soul who is his Lord, who is the man that was sent to you and what is your religion.
6. Soul is asked to look to the left, where he sees Hell and frightened. If the person was a believer and done good deeds, angels say that Allah saves you from torment because you were a believer. Then the souls is asked to look to the right where he sees the Heaven. When he sees the Heaven, he asks God to end this world so that he can come to Jannah right now.
7. (The souls is put to sleep? or also souls can communicate with each other.)

The Unseen World Becomes Visible at Death

فَكَشَفْنَا عَنكَ غِطَاءَكَ فَبَصَرُ‌كَ الْيَوْمَ حَدِيدٌ (Now We have removed your veil from you; so your sight today is sharp...50:22). There is a difference of opinion regarding the addressees of this verse. The preferred opinion is that Allah addresses mankind in general. This includes the believers, the unbelievers, the pious and the wicked. Ibn Jarir, Ibn Kathir and others have adopted this interpretation. The analogy drawn here is that this world is like the dream-world and the Hereafter is like the state of wakefulness. When man is in the dream-world, his eyes are closed and cannot perceive by his physical organs of sight the stark realities of the next world. When the physical organs of sight close, his dream-world ends and the state of wakefulness begins, and he is able to discern the stark realities of the Hereafter. Therefore, scholars have formulated the following aphorism:

النَّاسُ نِیَامُ فَاذِا مَاتُوا اِنتَبَھُوا

"People are sleeping in this world; when they die, they will wake up.

Souls also leave the body during our sleep.

    It is Allah Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed. Verily, in this are signs for a people who think deeply”
    az-Zumar 39:42

Al-Bara’ ibn ‘Azib reported: The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, said, “Verily, when the believer is ready to depart the world and is facing the Hereafter, angels from heaven descend with bright faces, as if their faces were the sun, with them are the shrouds and perfumes of Paradise, until they sit from him a distance as far as the eye can see. Then, the angel of death, upon him be peace, comes until he sits by his head and he says: O pure soul, come out to the forgiveness of Allah and His pleasure! He takes it out like a drop from a water-skin and holds it, never to leave his hand for the blink of an eye until he places it in that shroud and perfume. The scent coming from it is more pleasant than any musk you would find on the face of the earth. He ascends and passes by no gathering of angels but that they say: What a pure spirit! They say he is this person, son of this person, calling him by the best names by which he was known in the world, until he stops at the lowest heaven and seeks entry and it will be opened for him. The company of each heaven bring him closer to the heaven following it until he stops at the seventh heaven. Allah Almighty will say: Write the record of My servant in the righteous register and return him to the earth, for from it I created them, to it I return them, and from it I will take them out once again. His spirit will be returned to his body and two angels will come to sit by him, saying to him: Who is your Lord? He will say: My Lord is Allah. They will say: What is your religion? He will say: My religion is Islam. They will say: Who is this man sent you? He will say: He is the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him. They will say: How did you know? He will say: I read the Book of Allah, had faith in it, and believed in it. A heavenly announcement will be made: My servant has spoken the truth! Spread out carpets for him in Paradise, clothe him for Paradise, and open a gate for him to Paradise! Its comforts and fragrances will come to him and his grave will become spacious as far as his eye can see. A handsome man, with fine clothes and wonderful fragrance, will come and say: Glad tidings of what pleases you, for this was your Day you were promised! He will say: Who are you with such a handsome face? He will say: I am your righteous deeds! He will say: O Lord, begin the Hour that I may return to my family and property!”

The Prophet continued, “Verily, when the unbeliever is ready to depart the world and is facing the Hereafter, angels descend from heaven with darkened faces and with them sack-cloth. They will sit away from his as far as the eye can see. Then, the angel of death approaches until he sits by his head and he says: O filthy soul, come out to the displeasure of Allah and His wrath! He will be separated from his body like the tearing of skewers from wet wool and he holds it in his hand, never to leave it for the blink of an eye, until he places it in this sack-cloth. The scent coming from it is like the most foul corpse found upon the face of the earth. They will ascend with him and not pass by a gathering of angels but that they say: What a filthy spirit! They say he is this person, son of this person, calling him by the ugliest names by which he was known in the world, until he stops at the lowest heaven. They will request it to be opened for him but it will not open.” Then, the Prophet recited the verse, “The gates of heaven will never open for them, nor will they enter Paradise, until the camel goes through the eye of the needle,” (7:40). The Prophet said, “Allah Almighty will say: Write his record in the wicked register in the lowest earth. His spirit will be thrown down,” then the Prophet recited the verse, “It is as though he had fallen from the sky and was snatched by the birds 🐦🐦🐦 or the wind carried him down into a remote place,” (22:31). The Prophet said, “His spirit will return to his body and two angels will come to sit by him, saying to him: Who is your Lord? He will say: Uh, uh, I do not know! They will say: What is your religion? He will say: Uh, uh, I do not know! They will say: Who is this man sent to you? He will say: Uh, uh, I do not know! A heavenly announcement will be made: He has lied! Spread carpets for him in Hellfire and open a gate for him to Hellfire! Its heat and its flames will approach him, and he will be squeezed in his grave until his ribs press together. An ugly man, with hideous clothing and a foul stench, will approach him and say: Glad tidings of what despairs you, for this is your Day you were promised! He will say: Who are with your evil face? He will say: I am your wicked deeds! He will say: O Lord, do not begin the Hour!”

Source: Musnad Aḥmad 18534

Grade: Sahih (authentic) according to Al-Arna’ut

    In the name of Allah, The Almighty Creator, Owner of Life and Death.

Holy Quran - As-Sajda 32:11

    (Muhammad), say “The angel of death, who is appointed over everyone of you, will cause you to die and to your Lord you will all return”

In Islam, when someone is about to die then few things will happen:

Few moments before death, the person would start to see what is usually unseen for the human eyes (God describe this as the eyes being unveiled to finally see the truth)
The Angel of Death will come to the person but how the look of the Angel of Death depends on the state of the person (which means how the Angel will appear is determined by the deeds of the person: Good deeds or bad deeds)
When a good person dies (a person who did good deeds): The Angel of Death will appear as a bright entity, very bright light, beautiful face, clean, with hundreds of other angels behind him gathering, holding perfumes from Paradise, greeting the human being with peace (Salam). The angel will then take the soul out of the dying person’s softly as a drop of water.
When an evil person dies (a person who committed sins, bad deed): The Angel of Death will appear as a very terrifying entity, his look will be so terrifying that the person would not bare to look at him. To the extend his soul would want to run away hiding from the Angel of Death. The Angel will not great such person with Salam (peace), The Angel will violently tear away the soul from his body, so violent that the person would feel terrifying pain as if he would feel sharp rose thorns ripping him apart from the inside out. That’s how violent the Angel will rip apart the soul of the person who committed evil.
Holy Quran - An-Naazi’aat 79:1

    By the angels who violently tear-out the souls of the disbelievers from their bodies.

Holy Quran - An-Naazi’aat 79:2

    By the angels who gently release the souls of the believers.

This is the reason why in Islam, we are all encouraged to do goodness because nobody knows when we are going to die. We are encouraged to do good deeds because if we die when we are doing good, then we will have a peaceful death, the angels will welcome you, and God will be pleased with you that you died right just after doing good.

Islam teaches us to constantly be prepared for death for death can come at any moment, it can come today, tomorrow, in one month, in months, in years, we do not know. SO we always must be prepared for it.

Every person will feel the agony of death or what we call the intoxication of death. This means that before dying, the body will feel what is coming, the body will feel death is approaching, it’s a feel no one can describe, except that God mentioned that death comes with an agony and that everyone will feel it.

Holy Quran - Qaaf 50:18

The human being will certainly experience the agony of death.

Holy Quran - Qaaf 50:22

(He will be told), “You were completely heedless of this day. We have removed the veil from your eyes and your vision will now be sharp and strong”

The veil that hides the world of the unseen will be removed moments before death, so that the dying person would be aware of what is going and so that the dying person would start seeing the Angel of Death with his own eyes.

Holy Quran - Al-Furqaan 25:21

On the day when the criminals see the angels, there will, certainly, be no rejoicing for them. rather, they will plead to the angels, “Please keep away from us (do not drive us into hell)”

The verse above is a confirmation that on the moment of death, the human being will see the angels, before the soul will be taken out of the body

This video will give you a clear explanation of Death in Islam and what would happen. I love this series provided by Sheikh Bilal Asad. (Start at 19:50)

After a person is buries, two angels come to the died person and ask questions.  Munkar and Nakir (منكر ونكير) (English translation: "The Denied and The Denier") are angels who test the faith of the dead in their graves. The questioning will begin when the funeral and burial is over. Nakir and Munkar prop the deceased soul upright in the grave and ask three questions:

1. Who is your Lord?
2. What is your religion?
3. Who is your prophet?

A righteous believer will respond correctly, saying that their Lord is Allah, that Muhammad is their prophet and that their religion is Islam. If the deceased answers correctly, the time spent awaiting the resurrection is pleasant and may enter heaven. Those who do not answer as described above are chastised until the day of judgment. There is belief that the fire of hell can already be seen in Barzakh, and that the spiritual pain caused by this can lead to purification of the soul.

Muslims believe that a person will correctly answer the questions not by remembering the answers before death but by their iman (faith) and deeds such as salat (prayer) and shahadah (the Islamic profession of faith).

## Israfil Blows the Trumpet the first time (Destruction)

</summary>

Only Allah knows when the Hour comes. And at some point in time, the last hour will come.

The Akhirat will start after Israfil blows the trumpet for the first time.
There is a hadith that prophet Muhammad said, How can I ever relax when I know that Israfil is already holding the trumped in his mouth and looking at the Throne of Allah waiting for the signal to blow it.

There is a hadith that says the Trumped or the Horn will not be blown until there is no one left in this dunya who says La ilaha illallah. So before the beginning of the Hereafter, Allah will send a warm wind to this world, which will take away the souls of the believers.

Therefore, the people who will be then alive on the face of the earth will hear this blow that will cause the end of the world, and all of a sudden they will be struck insensible and will fall dead to an extent that none of them will be able to make a will. Allaah Says (what means): 

    They do not await except one blast, which will seize them while they are disputing. And they will not be able [to give] any instruction, nor to their people can they return.
    Quran 36:49-50

On the other hand, a Hadeeth reads: “Then the Trumpet will be blown, and no one hears it except that he will bend his neck to one side (in an attempt to listen to it) and raise it from the other side.” Then he [the Prophet  sallallaahu  alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention )] said: "And the first to hear it (the Trumpet) will be a man who is busy in repairing the tank meant for supplying water to his camels. He [the Prophet  sallallaahu  alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention )] said: "He will fall dead and the people will also fall dead." Moreover, the Prophet  sallallaahu  alayhi  wa  sallam ( may  Allaah exalt his mention ) told us about the speed of the death of the people when the Hour will take place, as he said: 

    "The Hour will occur while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it."

Quran says that the veil will be removed and people will be able to see the unseen.
sky will be opened.

## The Earth is destroyed

</summary>

After the first blow the Destruction of everything on the Earth will start.

#### Every Living Creature Dies

When the destruction begins, every living thin on Earth dies. Animals, people, jinn. There is no authentic source that says that angels will die as well but there are some narrations with weak isnad that suggest that. 

There is a narration that after the trumpet is blown, Iblis goes from one side of the Earth to another trying to escape death. But the Angel of Death somes to him and he dies.

There is a hadith with a weak chain of narrations:
The prophet (ﷺ   ) said after the horn is blown and the only ones that stand are the ones that your Lord willed, Allah SWT will have in front of Him Jibreel, Israfeel, Mikail, and angel of death. Those who apportion the command of Allah and Allah asks the angel of death who remain and he says O Allah Your Noble Face, your servant me, your servant Mikail, your servant Israfeel, and your servant Jibreel, Allah says take the soul of Mikail.

Then Allah says who remain he Azrail said O Allah You, me, Jibreel and Israfeel. And Allah says take the soul of Israfeel and Israfeel's soul is taken and Allah says who remain O Allah Your Noble Face, me and Jibreel.And Allah says take the soul of Jibreel.

The prophet ( ﷺ   ) said Jibreel would fall on his face as his wings spread glorifying Allah the Most High. He would die in Tasbih, subhanallah. Then Allah says who remain. O Allah it's just me and You, and Allah says to the angel of death to die and he dies.

And then Allah SWT says Every single soul perishes. And only the Noble Face of Your Lord remain, and Allah SWT would ask Himself " To Whom Belong The Dominion Today ? " Allah SWT says to Himself " To Allah The One, The Subduer"

Where are the ones with pride, the one with glory? 

In another version, eight angels who carry the Throne of Allah die before the Angel of Death.

## Second blow of the trumpet (Resurrection of the Dead)

</summary>

    And man (mockingly) asks: "Will I really be raised back to life after I die?"
    Does man not remember that We created him (once) before, when he was nothing?
    So I swear by your Lord, We will most certainly gather all of them again -- and the Shayatin -- and bring them around Jahannam on their knees...

The first resurrected creatures will the angel Israfil. Allah will resurrect him and command him to blow the trumpet for the second time.
The second blow will signal the resurrection from the dead all creatures that were once alive.

After the final signs of The Hour -- the defeat of the Sufyani; the end of the just reign of the Madhi and/or Jesus; the rising of the sun from the west; the peaceful death all believers from inhalation of a lethal breeze -- a trumpet will blast signaling the destruction of earth (Q.69:13–16); a second blast will signal the death of any being still living (except God).

The dead will then be resurrected and Afterlife commence with yet another trumpet blast, (different sources give different numbers of trumpet blasts) The first to arise will be Muhammad, followed by the other members of the Muslim community. with all gathering at the place of assembly [al-maḥshar]. In between resurrection and the actual judgement will be an agonizing wait (Q.21:103, Q.37:20) for the unbelievers.

The Judgement will not start for a long time, maybe thousands of years. People will worry about their deeds all the time. and they will come to prophets asking them to intercede in front of Allah to start the Jidgement because they can no longer wait. They will come to Adam, but Adam will say "Nafsi, nafsi", meaning that he is worried about himself because he disobeyed Allah and ate from the Tree 🌳 and Allah is so angry at this point as He has never been before.
Then people will come to Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa and Jesus, and they all say Nafsi, nafsi.
And finally they will come to the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    begging him to ask Allah to start the Judgement. and the prophet Muhammad ﷺ    will say "This is a job for me".

[The Day of Judgement lectures by  sheikh Yasir Qadhi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg0IlOvTklI&list=PLYZxc42QNctXqgEpxF8L-ZItU3uBAjtOR&index=6)

there is a hadith that says that the prophet Muhammadﷺ   will be resurrected and he will see that Musa is already holding to the Throne of Allah.

the first person to hear the trumpet will be a man who is giving water to his camel and he will fall dead. and all the rest will fall dead.

It is going to come suddenly.

the first trumpet will be blown at the time where there are no muslims left

there will be a slight rain and men will start resurrecting, bodies will start coming out of the graves.

Some people will be resurrected upside down. the prophet Muhammad said Allah who caused men walking on their legs will cause them walk on ther faces.
Surah Isra.
some will be resureccted deaf and blind. some of those who rejected signs will be resurrected in this manner.

People will see Jahannam.

ibn Abbas said that Judgement Day is a very very long day.
it will feel like many many lifetimes. ibn Abbas said to the Harajite that the punishment willl be in stages.

Shahid will be resurrected with their scars red as blood and they will smell of musk.

People who died in ihram will be resurrected in ihram.

Arrogant people will be resurrected as small as ants.

People will be recognized for what they used to do in this dunya.
The one who made athan will be known. 

People will resurrected naked and later some of people will be clothed.

The first to come out of the grave is prophet Muhammad SAW. The first to be clothed will be Ibrahim AS.

All animals will be resurrected to make sure that jusice is done completely. After hisab of animals, they will turn to dust. some people who commited injustice will wish to be perished to dust as those animals.

Some transformations of the earth will take place.
Hadith says people will be resurrected on a land pure white and clean and flat, no any hills, and markings. it will be strenched as far as the eye can see. a pure land upon which no sin is commited.

The one who calls, his voice will be hear, the one who wants to see will be seen.

creations will be in a state of fear and panic. Their necks are stretched, their hearts are empty in their chests, their eyes are glazed.

the ones who rejected prophet Muhammad will wish that the aerth swallowed them.

Quran says "Don't ever think that Allah is unaware" the Justice will be done.

The sun will come close to mankind and people will start to sweat according to their sinfulness. others will be in sweat by their ankles, some will be in sweat up their chest, some will drown completely in their sweat.

How long will the Day of Judgement be? sura Hajj 47, 
on a day as long as 50 thousand years. Magarij

surah Sajda verse 5. There shall be an ascent 1000 years.

ibn Abbas said "La adri" -- "I do not know".

Hadith says the Day of Judgement will be 1000 years of your comprehension.

For the mumin the Day will be like the time between Asr and Maghrib.

Hadith from Abu Huraira:
> Anyone who owns gold or silver that he doesn't pay zakat on it, that zakat will turn into fire that will be used to burn his sides in a day that will stretch to 50 thousand years. Then he will see whether he will go to Heaven or Hell.

There are different interpretations. There is clearly evidence that for some people the Day of Judgement will be a very difficult and long.

During that time people will be so exasperated, so that some will be ready to go to Jahannam.

hadith:
> Whoever wants to see the day in vivid detail as if you are looking at it, let him read Shamsu Qubirat and Fatarat.

The sun is rolled up, stars are diminished, muntaines are moving in motion, when all realtionships are broken and suspended, when all animals will be gathered together, when oceans will become flames, when souls are paired up, when a child that was killed will be asked why was she killed and buried alive, when your scrolls that remained hidden are made public. when the sky is peeled away, when the fire is set ablaze, Jamah is brought close. On that Day every soul will have in front of him what that souls prepared for the Day of Judgement.

People will run around and they will not care about their brothers, wives or relatives. People will be silent, they will not be allowed to speak. Only walking feat or mumbling will be heard. Only prophets will be allowed to speak that Day.

And then will be the intercession of prophet Muhammad SAW.

There wil be intercession of some people if Allah gives permission. Allah will allow children who died during childhood to intercede on behalf of their parents. There is no guarantee that their shafa'a will be accepted. If Allah allows, their shafa'ah will be accepted.

At the time of panic, Allah will honor some people to speak and to intercede.
The higher their iman, the more people will be allowed for them to intercede.

## The Judgement

</summary>

<img src="/Ibn_arabi_judgement_day.png" alt="Early Expansion"> 

Diagram of the "Plain of Assembly" (Ard al-Hashr) on the Day of Judgment, from an autograph manuscript of Futuhat al-Makkiyya written by the Sufi mystic and Muslim philosopher Ibn Arabi, ca. 1238.

The Judgement will not begin until thousands of years people will wait. 

the prophet Muhammad SAW will recognize Muslims because of Wudu.

Every criminal every tyrant will be marked and stamped. everyone's sin will be revealed unless Allah choses to hide some of them.
everyone will come out of their graves.

Jinns and every animal will be resurrected as well. 

The prophet (ﷺ   ) said As we all come back, the earth is flattened out of the glory and obedience to Allah SWT and each and every single person will not be able to move from the spot that they are standing in the place of assembly. And I would be the first person to be called to Allah and fall in prostration.

When I raise my head and suddenly see Jibreel (as) on the right side of the Most Merciful and you know what he says in this " I swear by Allah Jibreel never  ﷺ    Allah before that Day.

People will come to Adam and ask him to interrogate but he will reject it. and after Nuh, Musa, Isa and some others, people will come to the prophet Muhammad. and he will say that is my task.

There will be pool from Al Kawthar near the prophet Muhammad, and it will be allowed to sincere Muslims to drink from it.
Allah says in the Quran that He has already gifted the prophet Muhammad Al Kawthar, the main river of Jannah. It's water is pure white and whoever drinks for it will not feel thirst for thousands of years.

People will hear Jahannah roar and it will have desire to take the sinners.

People will have their good deeds on the right side and their bad deeds on the left side. 

It will be the time of Ultimate Justice. Allah's promise will be fulfilled for everyone.

People will have pass through the Sirat bridge above Jahannam. and it will be easy to pass for good people and it will be difficult to pass for bad people and they will fall to Jahannam. Animals sacrificed in the name of Allah will assist people to pass the Sirat.

The angel that guards the gates of Heaven will ask: "Who is there?". The prophet Muhammad will reply Muhammad. And malak will say that he is the one for whom the gates must be open. and he will be the first to enter Jannah.

There are several narrations that some of the people who ended up in Jahannam will be allowed to enter Jannah after some time passes and their sins are burned. They will be placed into the river of Jannah where they will regain their shape and start living in Jannah.

#### The Mizan. the Scale

Separation of the righteous and the damned
At divine judgment, the resurrected will stand in a grand assembly, each person's Book of Deeds -- where "every small and great thing is recorded" -- will be read, and ultimate judgment made. The resurrected will then walk over the bridge of As-Sirāt, those judged worthy for the Garden continuing to their heavenly abode, those damned to The Fire, falling off the bridge into the pit of Jahannam. There will also be a punishment of the grave (for those who disbelieved) between death and the resurrection.

Not everyone consigned to hell will remain there, as it is believed by both scholars and lay Muslims that "all but the mushrikun, those who have committed the worst sin of impugning the tawḥīd of God, have the possibility of being saved;" and God's intercession to save sinners from hellfire is a "major theme" in popular Islamic stories about Judgement Day.

Narrated Abu Huraira:

The people said, "O Allah's Messenger ﷺ  ! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" He replied, "Do you have any doubt in seeing the full moon on a clear (not cloudy) night?" They replied, "No, O Allah's Messenger ﷺ   !" He said, "Do you have any doubt in seeing the sun when there are no clouds?" They replied in the negative. He said, "You will see Allah (your Lord) in the same way. On the Day of Resurrection, people will be gathered and He will order the people to follow what they used to worship. So some of them will follow the sun, some will follow the moon, and some will follow other deities; and only this nation (Muslims) will be left with its hypocrites. Allah will come to them and say, 'I am Your Lord.' They will say, 'We shall stay in this place till our Lord comes to us and when our Lord will come, we will recognize Him. Then Allah will come to them again and say, 'I am your Lord.' They will say, 'You are our Lord.' Allah will call them, and As-Sirat (a bridge) will be laid across Hell and I (Muhammad) shall be the first amongst the Apostles to cross it with my followers. Nobody except the Apostles will then be able to speak and they will be saying then, 'O Allah! Save us. O Allah Save us.' There will be hooks like the thorns of Sa'dan in Hell. Have you seen the thorns of Sa'dan ?" The people said, "Yes." He said, "These hooks will be like the thorns of Sa'dan but nobody except Allah knows their greatness in size and these will entangle the people according to their deeds; some of them will fall and stay in Hell forever; others will receive punishment (torn into small pieces) and will get out of Hell, till when Allah intends mercy on whomever He likes amongst the people of Hell, He will order the angels to take out of Hell those who worshipped none but Him alone. The angels will take them out by recognizing them from the traces of prostrations, for Allah has forbidden the (Hell) fire to eat away those traces. So they will come out of the Fire, it will eat away from the whole of the human body except the marks of the prostrations. At that time they will come out of the Fire as mere skeletons. The Water of Life will be poured on them and as a result they will grow like the seeds growing on the bank of flowing water. Then when Allah had finished from the Judgments amongst his creations, one man will be left between Hell and Paradise and he will be the last man from the people of Hell to enter paradise. He will be facing Hell, and will say, 'O Allah! Turn my face from the fire as its wind has dried me and its steam has burnt me.' Allah will ask him, "Will you ask for anything more in case this favor is granted to you?' He will say, "No by Your (Honor) Power!" And he will give to his Lord (Allah) what he will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then turn his face from the Fire. When he will face Paradise and will see its charm, he will remain quiet as long as Allah will. He then will say, 'O my Lord! Let me go to the gate of Paradise.' Allah will ask him, 'Didn't you give pledges and make covenants (to the effect) that you would not ask for anything more than what you requested at first?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched, amongst Your creatures.' Allah will say, 'If this request is granted, will you then ask for anything else?' He will say, 'No! By Your Power! I shall not ask for anything else.' Then he will give to his Lord what He will of the pledges and the covenants. Allah will then let him go to the gate of Paradise. On reaching then and seeing its life, charm, and pleasure, he will remain quiet as long as Allah wills and then will say, 'O my Lord ! Let me enter Paradise.' Allah will say, May Allah be merciful unto you, O son of Adam! How treacherous you are! Haven't you made covenants and given pledges that you will not ask for anything more that what you have been given?' He will say, 'O my Lord! Do not make me the most wretched amongst Your creatures.' So Allah will laugh and allow him to enter Paradise and will ask him to request as much as he likes. He will do so till all his desires have been fulfilled. Then Allah will say, 'Request more of such and such things.' Allah will remind him and when all his desires and wishes; have been fulfilled, Allah will say "All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides." Abu Said Al-Khudri, said to Abu Huraira, 'Allah's Messenger ﷺ   said, "Allah said, 'That is for you and ten times more like it.' "Abu Huraira said, "I do not remember from Allah's Messenger ﷺ   except (his saying), 'All this is granted to you and a similar amount besides." Abu Said said, "I heard him saying, 'That is for you and ten times more the like of it."

## Al Ar'af

</summary>

There will be a barrier [ḥijāb] between Paradise and Hell. And on the heights [al-aʿrāf] of that barrier˺ will be people who will recognize ˹the residents of˺ both by their appearance. They will call out to the residents of Paradise, "Peace be upon you!" They will have not yet entered Paradise, but eagerly hope to (Q.7:46).

As for who the inhabitants of the inhabits al-aʿrāf are, the "majority of exegetes" support the theory that they are persons whose actions balance in terms of merit and demerit -- whose good deeds keep them from the Fire and whose evil deeds keep them from the Garden. They will be the last to enter the Garden, at the mercy of their Lord.

## Opening the Gates of Paradise

</summary>

In the hadith about intercession that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “I will come to the gate of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection and will ask for it to be opened. The keeper will say: ‘Who are you?’ I will say, ‘Muhammad.’ He will say: ‘I was commanded not to open it for anyone before you.” Narrated by Muslim (197)

Another report in the Sahihayn is in different words,“The first group to enter Paradise will be glittering like the moon (as it appears) on a full moon night. Those to follow them will be like the most shiny star in the sky. They will not spit therein, nor blow their noses, nor attend a nature’s call. Their combs will be of gold and silver, and sweat of misk. Their incense of pearls, and aloe wood used for fire. Their spouses will be wide-eyed Houries. All of them on one nature, on the face of their father Adam, sixty feet (tall) in the heaven.”

There are a few other reports about those who will enter first through the gates of Paradise. The following is in the Sahihayn: Abu Hurayrah reported the Prophet as having (once) said, “Seventy-thousand of my Ummah will enter Paradise, their faces shining as bright as the moon on a full moon night.” Abu Hurayrah said, “At that `Ukk asha got up lifting a shroud on him and said, ‘Messenger of Allah. Supplicate to Allah that He place me as one of them.‘ He said, ‘O Allah, make him one of them.‘ Then another man of the Ansar stood up and said, ‘Messenger of Allah. Supplicate to Allah that He place me as one of them.’ He replied, ‘`Ukk asha overtook you therewith.” According to another report (of Bukhari and Muslim), the Prophet (saws) said,“Surely, seventy thousand of my followers, or seven hundred thousand, the first of whom will not enter Paradise until the last of them enters. Their faces shining bright like the moon on a full-moon night.”

According to another tradition recorded by Tirmidhi, the Prophet said,“My Lord has promised me that He will admit seventy thousand of my followers into Paradise, without they undergoing any reckoning or any punishment, along with another seventy thousand and (over and above them) three handfuls from the Handfuls of my Lord” (Ibn Kathir).

The above report was declared Hasan Gharib by Tirmidhi. However, after mentioning the above in his “Fath”, Ibn Hajr quoted another hadith on the above topic from Ibn Hibb an and Tab arani, which he declared trustworthy. It says,“Then every thousand will intercede for seventy thousand. Thereafter, my Lord will usher in three handfuls of His two Handfuls.” When Umar said “Allah is the Greatest” the Prophet added, “The seventy thousand will be allowed to intercede for their fathers, mothers and family members, and I hope that the handfuls will be from the lowest of my followers.”
