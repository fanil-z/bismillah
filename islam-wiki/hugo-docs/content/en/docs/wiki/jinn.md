Allah created jinns from smokeless fireüî•, the edge of the flame. 

Jinns are the only creatures besides human beings that have a free will and they will be judged according to their deeds.

Jinn are mentioned approximately 29 times in the Quran.

 Surah Al Hijr verse 27 , Allah says:

    "And the jinn We created before from scorching fire."

It is also mentioned in Surah Rahman, verse 15 :

    "And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire."

Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H) also said the same thing mentioned in the above verses that,

> ‚ÄúThe Angels were created from light and the Jinn from smokeless fire.‚Äù (Sahih Muslim)

    "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."
    Quran, Surah Al-Dhariyat ayah 56

The above verse shows the same core purpose of life for both the humans and the jinn. Their purpose of life is not very different from the humans as they are ordered by Allah to do the same good deeds as humans do and they are supposed to obey and worship one and only God ‚ÄúAllah‚Äù. Like in humans there are two broader categories, Muslims and Non-Muslims, similarly in jinn there are the same two main divisions (the Muslims and Non-Muslims).

Many Non-Muslims enter into the religion Islam despite of having a Non-Muslim background because of some influence towards the religion Islam. Same is the case with jinn; the Non-Muslim jinn can also turn Muslims if they get inspired by the religion Islam.

At the time of Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H), a group of jinn were turned into Muslims when they heard the recitation of Holy Quran. At that time Allah revealed the following verses of Surah Jinn on Prophet Mohammad (P.B.U.H),

    Say, [O Muhammad], "It has been revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an. It guides to the right course, and we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.'" 
    Quran 72:1-2

The lives of jinn are very similar to the humans, they eat, they drink, they marry, they have their children, and even they are instructed and guided the same way as humans. We can clearly understand this statement by the following verse of Surah Al-An‚Äôam.

    "O company of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?" They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves"; and the worldly life had deluded them, and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers. 
    Quran [6:130]

This verse shows that messengers were not only sent down to guide the humans but they were sent down to guide both the humans and jinn.

Jinns have males and females, they have different religions, tribes, nations.
The jinn live in the parallel world to the humans and since they live in the different dimension the flow of time there is different too. Hence, the life span of jinn is different and believed t obe much longer.

There are believers and unbelievers both, in regard to this creature ‚Äújinn‚Äù. The unbelievers are called ‚ÄúSatan‚Äù. Iblis was the jin who turned into unbeliever when he was asked by Allah to prostrate in front of Adam (A.S) but he refused and he was cast out of heaven. Now, we call Iblis a Satan because he is an unbeliever. Jinn have the powers to see us but we (humans) cannot see them. The believers among the jinn try to take us on the wrong path and they try to take us away from the remembrance of Allah. Allah has already made us aware of this in the Surah Al-Araf, verse 27:

    ‚ÄúO children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe‚Äù.

The above verse clearly states that jinn have the power to see humans and to take possessions on the humans. The only way to keep ourselves safe from the evil beings is to pray five times, to walk on the path which Allah and His messenger (P.B.U.H) has shown us, and to follow the teaching of Quran, Sunnah, and Hadith.

In Islamic tradition, Muhammad was sent as a prophet to both human and jinn communities, and that prophets and messengers were sent to both communities. Traditionally, the 72nd surah, Al-Jinn, named after them, is held to tell about the revelation to jinn and several stories mention one of Muhammad's followers accompanied him, witnessing the revelation to the jinn.

In the story of Solomon they appear as nature spirits comparable to Talmudic shedim. Solomon was gifted by God to talk to animals and spirits. God granted him authority over the rebellious jinn and devils forcing them to build the First Temple. In other instances, the Quran tells about Pagan Arabs, calling jinn for help, instead of God. The Quran reduced the status of jinn from that of tutelary deities to that of minor spirits, usually paralleling humans.

the Jinn were allowed to enter heavens to listen to angels. That stopped when the Iqra came.

Jinns lived on the Earth and they could go beyond the Earth. Iblis was the best of jinn and he was allowed to be among the angels.

The term jin occurs thirty nine times in the Qur‚Äôan. There is a whole sura called sura al-Jinn, which speaks clearly and explicitly about the jinn. They are a part of divine creation separate from humanity and the angels, but they share certain qualities with mankind, like intellect, discrimination and the capacity for freedom.

In the Qur‚Äôan, Allah mentions the word jin as jan, jinnah, and jin. The word of al-jan shows in plural meaning and indicates as a creature that is hidden from the insights, as mentioned in sura al-Hijr verse 27. This verse explains the jinn
were created before the creation of mankind, and their origin is from smokeless fire. This fire was taken from the clean, pure, extremely hot and the most excellent (Ibn Kathir, 1999; al-Alusi, n.d)

Most of exegetes said Jann was the father of jinn as Adam was father to the mankind (Al-Razi, 1981). The jinn live in a world that cannot be seen with the senses. According to most of scholars, they eat, drink and procreate. Similar to humans, some are righteous while others are not.

In addition, the Qur‚Äôan also mentions Ifrit in sura al-Naml (The Ant) verse 39 and khannas in sura al-Nas (The Mankind) verse 4 which both mean the jinn. Moreover, the exegetes noted the Qur‚Äôan has given a description and explanation about the jinn and their social condition. Al-Tabari (2001) for example in his commentary explains that human and jinn were created as creatures who have the obligation to surrender and worship God as the creator. Allah mentioned in sura al-Dhariyat (The Winnowing Winds) verse 56 that indicates the existence of the jinn which means:

    "And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me."
    Quran (al-Dhariyat)

According to the majority of scholars the jinn are being obliged to follow the Islamic law that was revealed by Allah to His Messenger Muhammad (Al-Shibli, 1985). They are obliged as well as human in obeying of all commands and avoid the prohibitions (Bali, 1998, Al-Ashqar, 1999), as described in sura al-Rahman (The Beneficient) verse 13:
    
    So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?

According to al-Razi (1981) in his exegetical work the discussion appearing in this verse is addressed to the jinn and mankind. It means that the jinn are obliged to act in accordance with Allah‚Äôs orders and to perform worshipping like humans.
From here, the jinn conditions as human beings, among them have accepted the revelation of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). They are part of the divine creation and have attitudes, namely intellect, ability to be free and independent. They have the power to choose between true and false, right and wrong as Allah said in sura al-Jinn
verse 11 below: `And among us are the righteous, and among us are [others] not so; we were [of] divided ways.`

#### Era of Jinn on Earth

[Most of information in this section cannot be found in the Quran and the Sunnah. But it is derived from early interpretators of the Quran, including sahaba.]
Jinns were transgressing and were not treating animals well.

Angels and Iblis were send to annihilate many jinns who were transgressing.

The community of the jinn race were like those of humans, but then corruption and injustice among them increased and all warnings sent by God were ignored. Consequently, God sent his angels to battle the infidel jinn. Just a few survived, and were ousted to far islands or to the mountains. With the revelation of Islam, the jinn were given a new chance to access salvation. However, because of their prior creation, the jinn would attribute themselves to a superiority over humans and envy them for their place and rank on earth.

There is a rule for the Jinn not to cross the barrier between their world and our world, and the tresspassers will be asked for it.

Ifrit who brought Suleiman smo's throne.
some were diving in the oceans, some building.
the jinns don't know the unseen world. otherwise they would stop working immediately after Suleiman died.

#### The Shaitan
Iblis was amongst the best of jinn. some narrations say he worshipped Allah in all of the heavens and he was raised almost to the rank of angels. Then he came to Allah and asked to send him and some angels to punish the transgressing jinn who were living on the earth. So they started destroying the jinn that lived on earth only a scarce amount of them remained here and there. and Allah knew that Iblis wants his own kingdom for himself. so He created Adam to test Iblis, to reveal his intentions. And He asked angels and IBlis to bow before Adam which he disobeyed refused to do.  

Surah 18:50
Will you o human beings take him and his children as allies while he is your enemy.
he has children. 
he has waswasa to influence humans.

#### Classification of Jinn

According to Arabic linguists there are different categories of jinn: 
1. jinni, in general terms. 
2. Amir or dweller if the jinn lives in houses with people 
3. Arwah or spirits who interact with children. 
4. Shaytan or Satan if the jinn is wicked.
5. if he is worse than that, called marid or demon. 
6. Ifrit, if he is worse than that and strong (al-Shibli, 1985). 

In general, the pagan believe that jinn have hidden powers, giving some benefit and harassment. As Allah says in Sura Saba‚Äô verse 41:

    They will say, "Exalted are You! You, [O Allah], are our benefactor not them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them."

Similarly in Sura al-Jinn verse 6, Allah explains that most pagan seek help and protection to jinn. In view of them there is collaboration between man and poets of jinn which they can produce beautiful poetry to listen to (Shihab, 2002)

There is a special type of jinns - shayatin (devils). According to most sources, After Satan disobeyed Allah and vowed to lead humans astray, some jinns followed Satan, and they became shayatin, whose job is to lead people astray. and when a person is born, a shayatin is assigned to follow this person every day and whisper bad thoughts.

The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ‚ÄúAllah, may He be blessed and exalted, says: ‚ÄòI created all of My slaves as hunafa‚Äô (sing. haneef, i.e., believing in monotheism), but the devils diverted them from their belief.‚Äô‚Äù End quote from Ta‚Äôweel Mukhtalaf al-Hadith (p. 200).
