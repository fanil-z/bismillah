ALLAH TAâ€™ALA SAYS: â€˜SEARCH FOR ME AND YOU WILL FIND MEâ€™

Hafiz Ibn Kahtir (rahimahullah) has cited a narration in his Tafsir which has the mention of Allah Taâ€™ala saying :

â€˜ O Son of Adam, I created you for my worship so do not be unmindful of this, I have taken responsibility of your sustenance so do not tire yourself so search for me you will definitely find me, for if you have found me, you have found every thing and if you lose me, everything has lost you and I should be the most beloved to youâ€™

(Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Surah, 51 verse, 60)

ðŸŒŒ
Humans are created between angels and animals. Angels dont have their own desires they only worship Allah. and animals are living on their instincts and dont worship Allah as the angels so.
and if human beings incline to instincts, they become worse than animals. and if they incline towards worshipping Allah, they become better than angels.
Adam was the last of Allah's creations.


about 70 years ago there was a consensus in the scientific world that the universe is eternal, which contradicts the Quran that says Allah started the universe. and after 20 years more cosmic data came and scientists accepted that the Big Bang Theory make more sense. 

Arab people didn't even count the years. the calendar was adopted only during the reign of khalif Umar ibn Al Khattab.
