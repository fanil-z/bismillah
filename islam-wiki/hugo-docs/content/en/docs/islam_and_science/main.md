100 years ago, the world’s best scientific minds thought that the universe had always existed. Since it always existed, it didn’t need a Creator.

Einstein changed all that.

His ‘field equations’ suggested that the universe was expanding like a balloon. The mathematician and Belgian Priest, George Lemaître, realised that this expansion had to have started from somewhere. It must have come from an initial, dense point. This idea became known as the Big Bang. Today, it is the basis for understanding the origin of the universe.

What few people know however is that the Holy Quran described the Big Bang perfectly, 1400 years earlier.

	اَوَ لَمۡ یَرَ الَّذِیۡنَ کَفَرُوۡۤا اَنَّ السَّمٰوٰتِ وَ الۡاَرۡضَ کَانَتَا رَتۡقًا فَفَتَقۡنٰہُمَا ؕ وَ جَعَلۡنَا مِنَ الۡمَآءِ کُلَّ شَیۡءٍ حَیٍّ ؕ اَفَلَا یُؤۡمِنُوۡنَ	
	"Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were a closed-up mass (ratqan), then We opened them out? And We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?" 
	Holy Quran, 21:31

The arabic word ratqan means a closed-up mass. It also means darkness. A dark, closed-up mass is a perfect description of what we know the universe looked like in its earliest moments. The heavens and the Earth were indeed opened out from this mass to produce the universe we see today.

The verse further says that water is the basis of life. This is now an accepted scientific fact. When NASA look for planets that can bear life, they look for water.

#### The Expansion of the Universe

For many centuries the Quran contradicted the established opinion of scientists who thought that the universe was static.

<summary> Read about the expansion of the universe in the Quran </summary>

Einstein’s equations tell us that the universe is expanding. This discovery surprised everyone.

For decades thereafter, scientists thought the universe exploded out of the Big Bang, and has been slowing down ever since. But they were wrong. The universe’s expansion has recently been speeding up. This mysterious re-expansion is driven by what we call dark energy. About 5 billion years ago, this mysterious anti-gravity began pushing the universe outwards once more.

The Holy Quran describes this perfectly:

	وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ>
	 "And We have built the heaven with might and We continue to expand it indeed."
	 Holy Quran 51:48

This astonishing verse does not just tell us that the universe has expanded. The arabic ‘la-mūsiʿūna’ tells us that the universe is continuing to expand.

Such a statement is a sure sign of the Prophet Muhammad’s truth, peace be upon him.

embrio development in the Quran
internal waves in the ocean and darkness

if you would want to ppopulate some ecosphere you wouldn't just create some module with steady features. you want these creatures to learn the environment factors and to adapt. this is like in the machine learning models, the best way to calculate something.

about coding the genome. and AI.
and the AI models are nothing but a code. and as any code in git, it has an author. a developer that created and adjusted it.

the mountains that make the earth firm
