Concept of evolution and creation as code.

Stages of manufacturing development.
1. Make a product by your own hands.
2. Use tools.
3. Fasten the process: buy some parts from other masters and save time.
4. Conveyer. Have people make separate stuff.
5. Conveyer with tools and machines.
6. Conveyer with robots.
7. Conveyer wih smart robots with AI.
8. Let AI design the product.
9. Let AI learn from mistakes and let it find some ways to improve the manufacturing process.
10. Give AI more freedom and ability to look for alternatives.
11. Make super AI that will organize the whole process.

So the most effective way to build a product is to create an AI that will train itself, replicate, learn on its own mistakes and mistakes of others and then choose to build what is the best option according to conducted research.

Sounds like evolution to me. Let's see what is the definition of evolution.

And what is an AI in the technical sense? AI is a code.
So, what is evolution in a biological sense? It is hidden somewhere in the genome code.

So, there is original source code somewhere. We just haven't found or deciphered that repository yet.

So, if we had for example a super smartest person on Earth and he had to create life on an empty planet with dynamic physical, chemical and cosmological laws. The most effective way to do so would be to create an AI that will build and constantly adjust it for you.

It is also the most effective way to make different types of creatures. random code changes when the AI tries to learn and adapt cause variotions in the results of its work.

In a world with different weather conditions, with dynamic laws of nature, evolution is the only way to survive for living creatures. A static creature that creates only replicas of itself will die when the range of his ability for some essential environmental parameter is exceeded. A smart AI-generated creature will also die, but the next generation or iteration of creations will be able to survive longer. and the next once again longer.

And the benefit of using evolution is that it adjusts to circumstances.

and if God wanted creatures to live by their free will and dont interfere but only show some natural signs. What kind of signs would that be? some magical fancy things? Like rainbow, like lightning and thunderbolt, like stars and trillion variotions of snowflakes? Or a caterpillar that for no reason decides to hid itself into a cocoon where 95% of its body will metamorphose into a completely different amazingly beautiful flying creature with reproductive organs.

when His creatures get smarter, they start to decipher how tha laws of nature work and stop treating those things as a miracle. 
and then the turn to send some people with knowledge that can explain things. the messengers. then people will forget wbout these messengers after several generations and they need some more messengers. and when writing books is already established in manufacturing level and when humanity is ready to preserve the word of God in an unchanged form, what is the time for?
It means that the message of God is preserved. and there is no need for any more messengers.
until the End of Times.


Different layers of programming language.
probably the same must be in the natural code

you write a code on Python, Python itself is written on top of C++.
and C++ is written on top of assembler or something like that and on the very bottom level it is just a huge bunch of 1s and 0s which are transferred into electric signals that go into physically tangible transistors our laptop CPUs and they make billions of switches and create some visual output on our displays.

The Ultimate Coder must have abilities to code in different layers and dimensions and know how to connect these dimentions to build a full stack of the Universe. I may be coding not only the biological genome but also the meta matters like laws of physics, chemical reactions, code of time and all other things.
