4 layer: Islamic view which is the most important

# First Layer

On the surface layer, any war is bad because it causes death and destruction. Innocent civilian people also often suffer from the war directly or indirectly, they may be killed, robbed, their houses and belongings may be destroyed, they may have to leave their home for a safer place, etc.
Islam allows to fight only against the one who opresses you.

There is a concept of Jihad in Islam which is translated as "a sacred war" and which is very often misunderstood. To understand jihad, one must read about the biography of the prophet Muhammad sww. 
In general there are several stages of jihad.

1. Jihad of Heart
First and the main stage of jihad is the continuous battle against your Nafs, against your own desires. Until you perfect your religion and character according to Islamic rules, you cannot go to the next step of jihad.

2. Jihad of Tongue

Jihad of tongue means telling people to try to correct people in their actions, teach them the right way from the islamic perspective and call people to worship Allah. It may also be reffered as da'wah.

If we analyze the life of the prophet Muhammad, we can derive the ideal plan of doing da'wah. 

Jihad of tongue has several stages within itself.

The very important thing before you start telling people that they are wrong is to be sure that you are not doing those things yourself. So, without winning the battle against your desires, you cannot tell people how they should behave.
Another important thing is to be knowlegable about the topic that you want to give da'wah. 

Then we can start calling our close people to islam. Relatives and firends. then friends of friends.
After mastering your character and religion, after surrounding yourself with close muslim friends and family members that support you, you can start doing public  da'wah.

For many of us people these two steps are the only battles that we need to fight. we cannot go further than that.


## Second Layer

in the daily life we tend to forget about geopolitic games and how governments work. al most all countries have armies some are really large. and the amount of rockets and bombs. 

Goverment works that
many people knew that it will eventually happen.

and about double standards of the western world.
wars happen all the time and ongoing and none of them are usually widely discussed. 
hunger exist all the time.
