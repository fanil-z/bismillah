Wnted to combine the guide from interlinked separate parts where each definition can be source for its own wiki page. hugo has functionality for snippets but seemed like it would require one-level higher content planning and too much overhead so I chose the simplest way.
So, I want this one thing and I have no idea how to get there or even where to start.
