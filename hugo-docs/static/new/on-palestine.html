<section1>
<p>When I moved to Germany I was telling my relatives and friends that you can actually express your concerns and opinions here. And I was amazed by that feature up until this spring when German government started to ban demonstrations in support for Peace in Palestine. </p>

<p>	I had a chance to talk to several Palestinians here in Berlin. All of them have relatives who were exiled from their homes, I did not ask about those who are dead. A lady from my Hajj agency who helped me with documents was born in Gaza. She showed me her German ID that states "XXX" as her nationality. Many Western countries still follow the one-sided narrative and do not recognize Palestine as an independent nation. Despite all the evidence that Palestine is being occupied by Israel. Despite United Nations declaring that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is illegal and The State of Palestine has been recognized by 139 of the 193 UN members. Despite all the evidence of human rights violations in Gaza and West Bank.</p>
	
<p>	Is it forbidden now to call for peace and to call to stop "flattening" residential areas? Since when it is an ongoing <b>Genocide</b>, killing thousands of civilians, children and babies is not condemned and considered as "did not do enough to underscore Israel’s right to self-defence"? Please, save us some time and rid the world of your ignorance.</p>

<p>	We must condemn all the media that presents the fake narrative and covers for and overlooks heinous crimes. We must condemn all parties who are involved in killing children and civilians, including people who endorse and approve such atrocities. We must condemn the US government that has been arming Israel and escalating the conflict for decades. And even now <a href="(https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/18/us-vetoes-un-resolution-calling-for-humanitarian-pause-in-israel-hamas-war">US is putting veto on UN resolution calling for humanitarian ceasefire</a>.</p>
	
<p>	And most importantly, we, as individuals and as communities, must condemn ourselves for letting the world fall into miserable, unjust, and evil state again and again.</p>
	
<p>	And all the unjust journalists and bloodthirsty influencers should know that even though the media was not covering it, all these years, the Muslim world was watching all <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/report-israel-and-occupied-palestinian-territories/">brutal raids and killings of civilian Palestinians</a>. We very well remember what happened last Ramadan in Al Aqsa, we remember how <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/05/un-experts-demand-justice-al-jazeera-journalist-one-year-anniversary-her">IDF killed an American journalist reporting the raid at the Jenin refugee camp</a> and then attacked mourners at her funeral. The world knows about the <a href="<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGVgjS98OsU">Catastrophy of Al-Nakba</a> with 15000 Palestinians dead and 0.75 million forcefully expelled from their homes. The world knows about illegal evictions and inhumane conditions behind the walls of Gaza and the West Bank. Don't be surprised why people are on the streets.</p>
	
<p>	The prophet Mohammed  ﷺ  taught us to speak up when we see injustice. We have multiple hadiths that teach Muslims to condemn the oppressor, defend the oppressed and rely on evidence rather than emotion.</p>

<p>	All corrupt media and individuals should know that every single mosque in the world is and was praying for Palestine. In jama'a and separately. On Jumah I hear a brother in prostration whispering "Falestine, Falestine.." We pray and make dua for peace and we pray for justice.</p>
	
<p>	The chain of violence must stop, humanitarian aid fully unblocked, people must be helped to find their home again. The war criminals must face their trial and governments must come in terms for peace. Tha sanity shall prevail, we cannot allow another bloody war in the Middle East.</p>

<p>If you want to better understand what has been happening in Palestine, you can just quickly listen to what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a> says about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict back in 2002. Pay attention to the part when he suggests to try <b>"the experiment of minimal honesty"</b>.</p>

<p><b>ISRAEL LIES ABOUT OCTOBER 7 EXPOSED</b></p>

<p>Israel lowers Oct. 7 death toll to 1,200 people, ministry says</p>
<p>Was in the live updates in CNBC: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/11/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-latest-news-on-gaza-conflict.html">https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/11/israel-hamas-war-live-updates-latest-news-on-gaza-conflict.html</a></p>

<p>Israel's Foreign Ministry says the official death toll in Hamas' Oct. 7 cross-border attack into Israel has been lowered to 1,200 people.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have previously estimated the death toll at 1,400.</p>

<p>The ministry gave no reason for the revision. But an Israeli official said the number had been changed after a painstaking weekslong process to identify bodies, many of which were mutilated or burned.</p>

<p>From the revealed list of decesed on 7th October, 356 soldiers and 59 police officers. Shin Bet people are also listed, but without rank.</p>
<p>However, this list includes about 37 soldiers killed after October 7th. There is also an official IDF website listing the fallen soldiers.</p>

<p>Israel released the names and ages of people killed in the October 7th Hamas attack:</p>
<ul>
	<li>🔴 Only one baby among the dead - No 40 beheaded babies - stories of babies being targeted were FAKE</li>
	<li>🔴 The amount of minors on the list was under 2%</li>
	<li>🔴 At least 31% were military personnel - by all estimates, well over 90% of the deaths in Israel's war on Gaza are civilians.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our prophet  ﷺ  taught us to be a good people in all aspects of this dunya. </p>

<p>We have a number of hadiths about answering to injustice. </p>

<p>a Hadith narrated by Qays bin Abi Hazm, may Allah be pleased with him, who said:

<code>“I heard Abu Bakr, may Allah be pleased with him, say, ‘Oh you people! I hear you reciting this verse: ‘Oh you who believe! Worry about your own selves. If you follow the right guidance, no harm can come to you from those who are in error.’ (al-Ma’idah 5:105) But I heard the Messenger of Allah ﷺ say: ‘Indeed when people see an oppressor but do not prevent him from doing evil, it is likely that Allah will punish them all.”</quote>

When we are sure that an evil was committed; not based on gossip or rumours, but strong evidence. Allah has stated clearly in the Qur’an in Surah al-Hujurat 49:6: 

<code>“Oh you who have believed, if a rebellious evil person comes to you with news, verify it…” We must be certain, through witnessing it ourselves or a testimony from someone who had witnessed it first-hand.</code>
