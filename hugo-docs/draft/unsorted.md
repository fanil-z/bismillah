Abu Bakr's tribe refused to give him protection, so he also decided to migrate. 
 ibn Dagina saw hom migrating and said he will give his protection to Abubakr. he was a chieftan of a neighboring tribe.

Quraish allowed but said he cannot pray publicly. Abubakr extended his house and begins praying out loud. he actually made a first mesjit.

people would gather around to listen to his recitation.
Quraish said now he cant pray in his house too.
Abubakr gave his protection back to Dagina and chose the protection of Allah.
the migrants came back. 

other Uthman was under protecion of al Walid and he returned it because he felt guilt wihle other muslims were prosecuted.

Emigrants went back to Abyssinia. the Quraish went to najashi with presents and said he must give them the migrants. the Najashi said I will listen to their story. Jagfar and all people came and made his famous speech.

Isa told this to the prophets.
Dajjal will come, then Isa AS will come and Dajjal will melt. then people will come to their lands and then Wadjuj and Madjuj will come out and drink all the water. untill Isa AS wil make dua to kill them and they will all die. and the lands will be covered b their bodies. IsaAS will make another dua to get rid of the bodies and Allah will send rain and bodies will be washed away. At this time it will be like a pregnant woman ready to give birth. 


Malik the guardian of hell never smiles even when said salam to the prophet  ﷺ   . Jibreel said Were he to have smiled to anybody that would have been you.

The first thing Allah created is the Pen.
Allah said 50 salah a day. Musa said the the prophet  ﷺ    go back to your Lord and ask to reduce the number of prayers. the prophet  ﷺ    went up and back 5 or 10 times until it was reduced to 5. So the Voice said it is decreed 5 salah but it will be rewarded with 50.

there are 5 layers of Qadr. daily and yearly Qadr may change.
Celebration of the prophet's ﷺ    birthday started 600 years after his death. many of scholars opposed it. 

After Hudaybiyah

The Battle of Mootah
The Campaign of Dhat es-Salasil
----
Before Conquest of Mecca

clay is made to build and fire is made to destroy

ABRAHAM'S prayer was answered, and rich gifts were continually
brought to Mecca by the pilgrims who came to visit the Holy House
in increasing numbers from all parts of Arabia and beyond. The
Greater Pilgrimage was made once a year; but the Ka'bah could also be
honoured through a lesser pilgrimage at any time; and these rites continued to be performed with fervour and devotion according to the rules
which Abraham and Ishmael had established. The descendants of Isaac
also venerated the Ka'bah, as a temple that had been raised by Abraham.
For them it counted as one of the outlying tabernacles of the Lord. But as
the centuries passed the purity of the worship of the One God came to be
contaminated. The descendants of Ishmael became too numerous to live
all in the valley of Mecca; and those who wentto settle elsewhere took with
them stones from the holy precinct and performed rites in honour of them.
Later, through the influence of neighbouring pagan tribes, idols came to be
added to the stones; and finally pilgrims began to bring idols to Mecca.
These were set up in the vicinity of the Ka'bah, and it was then that the
Jews ceased to visit the temple of Abraham.'
The idolaters claimed that their idols were powers which acted as
mediators between God and men. As a result, their approach to God
became less and less direct, and the remoter He seemed, the dimmer
became their sense of the reality of the World-to-come, until many of them
ceased to believe in life after death. But in their midst, for those who could
interpret it, there was a clear sign that they had fallen away from the truth:
they no longer had access to the Well of Zamzam, and they had even
forgotten where it lay. The jurhumites who had come from the Yemen
were directly responsible. They had established themselves in control of
Mecca, and the descendants of Abraham had tolerated this because
Ishmael's second wife was a kinswoman of Jurhum; but the time came
when the Jurhumites began to commit all sorts of injustices, for which they
were finally driven out; and before they left they buried the Well of
Zamzam. No doubt they did this by way of revenge, but it was also likely
that they hoped to return and enrich themselves from it, for they filledit up
with part of the treasure of the sanctuary, offerings of pilgrims which had
accumulated in the Ka'bah over the years; then they covered it with sand. 


e. The voices were
now not far off - five or six men at least- and they were still approaching.
The Prophet looked at Abu Bakr, and said: Grieve not, for verily God is
with us.! And then he said: "What thinkest thou of two when God is their
third?"? They could now hear the sound of steps, which drew nearer and
then stopped: the men were standing outside the cave. They spoke
decisively, all in agreement that there was no need to enter the cave, since
no one could possibly be there. Then they turned back the way they had
come.
When the sound of their retreating steps and voices had died away, the
Prophet and Abu Bakr went to the mouth of the cave. There in front of it,
almost covering the entrance, was an acacia tree, about the height of a
man, which had not been there that morning; and over the gap that was left
between the tree and the wall of the cave a spider had woven its web. They
looked through the web, and there in the hollow of a rock, even where a
man might step as he entered the cave, a rock dove had made a nesting
place and was sitting close as if she had eggs, with her mate perched on a
ledge not far above.

devil is derived from Diabolos the root is from Iblis.
Shatana - the one far away.
Iblis is the leader of the shayateen. anybody who brings you far away from Allah. Shayateen may also be people

Akhnaten and Nefertiti were monoteists

In Mandarin Chinese they have the concept of main God. situation was similar to meccans before Islam.

the Cheroki nation has a strong tradition about monotheism.

Monotheism is not something only from the middle east.

Muslims will lose Constantinople (Istanbul). 
Then Constantinople will be re-conquerred and then Dajjal will appear. When Dajjal appears, the safest place will be Madinah and Makkah.

Allah subḥānahu wa ta'āla (glorified and exalted be He) knows best 


Here’s a list of ‘minor signs’ compiled 1,400 years ago (which I took from ibn Kathir’s ‘The Signs of the Day of Judgement’). Now, ask yourself, which of these have yet to surface?

Widespread fornication and adultery – Marriage rates are at their lowest ever.
Widespread acceptance of usury and interest – Just look at world debt and the monetary system today.
The Bedouin Arabs competing in building tall structures – Easy to see. Just look to the Middle East and Dubai.
Alcohol consumption being widespread – I don’t think any of us would deny this!
The children will be filled with rage – We’re reading so much about gang crime and high school killings and the like, and even children who are aggressive towards their own parents.
Loss of Islamic knowledge / the mosques will be grand structures but devoid of knowledge.
An increase in earthquakes – This again is another quite clear sign that has come to pass and is gaining frequency.
Widespread killing and bloodshed – Whether we look at the global situation or closer to home, it’s definitely happening on a huge scale.
Women who are clothed yet naked / Men will look women and women will look like men / Men will lay with men and women will lay with women – The advent of gay marriage would seem to suggest this is definitely here to stay and grow.
Time will move quickly – Time is definitely passing us by far quicker than it used to.
Singing and dancing will become popular / people will dance into the night – Look at MTV and the nightclubbing phenomenon.
Immoral deeds will be committed openly.

"By the time they reach age 18, American children will have seen 16,000 simulated murders and 200,000 acts of violence (American Psychiatric Association, 1998)."

The bad thing I noticed about Wikipedia is there are a lot of articles written not by Islamic scholars but by Eastern 

Should I mention that some parts of a section are copied from Wikipedia page written by OatCookies, Cheezhai, Chewings72, Wulverine claws, Emir of Wikipedia, Funnyhat, Super ninja2, "I dream of horses" and 30 other authors? This gives you thoughts like probably "Super ninja" username was already taken and is there Super ninja3.

There are still tonnes of bugs and I quickly realized that my sense of beauty is not enough to fix all CSS issues.

Scripting. Wrote a basic bash script that pushed latest changes in the source, triggers Hugo to generate the website and pushes to production. Yes, testing on production.

Mesopotamia:
    1. Ubaid period (6500-3800bc)
    early village settlements. all population engaged in the production of food.
    Eridu - the settlement name. 
    the increasing food surplus allowed the creation of other professions like merchants, craftsmen, weavers, metallurges. the taxation and redistribution of food supply led to creation of governments. city of Uruq prospered.
    Society hierarchy appeared. The high priest had leading role in a temple, keppers scribes administrators and priests and at the bottom were producers: farmers and fishermen. Cineaform writing appeared. 

There's the whole science that studies the authenticity of Hadith. People study four years at the university to distinguish between authentic and non-authentic hadith.

### David in the Bible

This was after Samson.
The current King Saul declared war on Philistine. David was a shepherd. 
Saul hires David to play him music. Philistines send Goliaf with the army against israelites. David declares that he will beat the giant and kills the giant with one shot of his sling. 
David was successful in the wars and his popularity grows. Saul grows jealous. David flees to Moab and then lives in caves of Ziph. Saul searches him to kill him. .
Saul then ceases to kill David.
philistines kill Saul. David becomes the king 👑 of Israel. David conquers Jerusalem. 

The temple built by jinns 🏛️

Angels Harut and Marut taught magic in Babylon (between 1895BC and 539BC). it is mentioned in the Quran.

Iqrimah ibn Abu Jahl flees. but later he comes to Medina to accept Islam from the hands of the prophet Muhammad ﷺ   .

His Prophetic mission began on the 27th day of the month of Rajab, in the year 610 CE, when he received the first divine revelation. Then the Qur’an was revealed to the Prophet progressively according to the circumstances of the time over a period of 23 years.

There is a narration that Abi-Talib took the prophet  ﷺ    with him and the monk from the monastery told that this boy will be the prophet. This narration is not authentic and that story was most probably invented.
Solitude of shepherd gives opportunity to contemplate on the nature and teaches how to rule. Also, sheep shepherds are the most humble shepherds.

According to the Bible lifespan of people before THe Great Flood was much longer than after the flood.

Consider homosexuality for example. It is prohibited by the major religions of the world. Until the 20th century, it was considered immoral and a punishable offence in the US.

Now it has become so rampant that those who disapprove of it, let alone denounce it, are labeled as “intolerant and narrow-minded.” It is being promoted and celebrated widely to make it popular. Even the cartoons that children watch increasingly include homosexual references.


In Abrahamic religions, the common things are beliveing in the God of Abraham, believe in the concept of prophets and believe in the Judgement Day. 
Other large group of religions is dharmic religions that includes Hinduism and Buddism and Jainism. INstead of Judgement day they believe in reincarnation. they also believe in some sort of judgement: Karma.

Five Books (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy)

### Other incidents

The sayings of Muhammad (hadith), Islamic literature and Quranic exegesis also narrate some incidents of the life of Musa. One story goes that he is bathing apart from the other Israelites who all bathe together. This leads the Bani Israels to say that Musa does so due to a scrotal hernia. One day, when Musa is bathing in seclusion, he puts his clothes on a stone, and the stone flees with his clothes. Musa rushes after the stone, and when the Bani Israels see him, they say, 'By Allah, Musa has got no defect in his body". Musa then beats the stone with his clothes, and Abu Huraira 🐈 states, "By Allah! There are still six or seven marks present on the stone from that excessive beating". In a hadith, Muhammad states that the stone still has three to five marks due to Musa hitting it.

atheism is very recent phenomena.
the first person to proclaim himself an atheist was Nitzsche whos gone mad in his last years.1844 – 1900


Jewish Calendar and Orthodox Chiristians believe that people have been around the Earth for around 6 thousand years. It is not the islamic view.

There are some cave paintings that are 30thousand years old. These were not Neanthertals these were Homo-Sapiens.

So we have no problem assuming that the gyneology between Adam And Ismail tool 10-20 thousand years. The prophet ﷺ    said that the time between now and the Day of Judgement is like his two fingers. And now it is 1443 year after Hijrah. So it gives possibility to extend the humanity timeline as long as science findings. We don't have a set timeframe.

After death of prophet Muhammad's ﷺ   son, Allah sent the sura Kawsar.

    Verily, we have blessed You with Al Kauthar (a river in Paradise). So,offer prayer and sacrifice to your Lord. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.

> Narrated Anas bin Malik: One day the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sitting amongst us that he dozed off. He then raised his head smilingly. We said: What makes you smile. Messenger of Allah? He said: A Sura has just been revealed to me, and then recited: In the name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful. Verily We have given thee Kauthar (fount of abundance). Therefore, turn to thy Lord for prayer and offer sacrifice, and surely thy enemy is cut off (from the good). Then he (the Prophet) said: Do you know what Kauthar is? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: It (Kauthar) is a canal which my Lord, the Exalted and Glorious has promised me, and there is an abundance of good in it. It is a cistern and my people would come to it on the Day of Resurrection, and tumblers there would be equal to the number of stars. A servant would be turned away from (among the people gathered there). Upon this I would say: My Lord, he is one of my people, and He (the Lord) would say: You do not know that he innovated new things (in Islam) after you. Ibn Hujr made this addition in the hadith:" He (the Prophet) was sitting amongst us in the mosque, and He (Allah) said: (You don't know) what he innovated after you"

Abdallah ibn Zubayr separated and made his own khaliphate. he rebuilt te Kaaba and followed the hadith.
He was crucified in front of the Kaaba and that man destroyed it and rebuilt it.

5 stages of da'wa:

1. Private da'wa (3 years).
2. Open preaching with the tongue without military confrontation (10 years) last 6 were very difficult.
3. Open da'wa with the tongue with physical fight only with one party (only Quraish).
4. Open da'wa to all with 'izza. attack only if you need to defence (from treaty of Hudaybia until the conquest of Mecca)
5. Open da'wa along with physical confrontation against anyone who opposes islam.

This video will give you a clear explanation of Death in Islam and what would happen. I love this series provided by Sheikh Bilal Asad. (Start at 19:50)


(If anyone were to be saved from the squeezing of the grave, Sa’d bin Mu‘adh would have been saved from it.) [Imâm-i Ahmad]

In order to get some Hugo and CSS practice,
but in the order that was defined by the prophet Muhammad ﷺ  . That is why the main idea was to gather and currate stories of all prophets mentioned in the Quran and sahih hadith in one place and sort them according to a historical timeline.

I started wrapping up my notes about Islam into a static website and after one year of spending 20-30 minutes daily, the MD editor showed it would take 12 hours to read the whole thing.


To build the website, I used a static HTML generator -- Hugo. It is open-source, flexible; it has a large number of themes including themes for user manuals and API references. Hugo can be a good candidate if you use Markdown and want to implement the docs-as-code concept in your documentation department.

I will try to make a separate post about how the stack behind the website works inshaallah. Shortly, the overall stack looks like this:

1. Hugo: a static web-site generator that builds a static HTML/CSS/JS website using MD files as a source. It is open-source, flexible; it has a large number of themes including themes for user manuals and API references. Hugo can be a good candidate if you use Markdown and want to implement the docs-as-code concept in your documentation department.
  - Hyas: I used the Hyas theme to have a good-looking bootstrap layout.
    - Hyas depends on Node.js and a swarm of npm packages. On Windows, you will also need Chocolatey to configure it.
    - Doks theme. I had to add and tune some JS/CSS elements to adjust the website to my purposes. Doks is a bit too advanced for a beginner like me so I still has plenty of bugs to fix. There are standard Hugo themes that can be configured in 5 min.
2. Render: I am hosting the website on Render. Up to 100GB bandwisth a month is free. And 400 total build hours per month for free services and static sites. I also tried Netlify, basically the same functionality.
3. A pipeline on Render automatically fetches the latest commit in my git repo, installs all required npm packages, builds the website and pushes it to production. You can configure a test server on Render but I just test on my local machine.

the core structure of this guide is based on narrations of the Quran. Tafsir and verses are copied from various open sources.
> 
> Other sources of this guide include: authentic hadiths, some non-authentic hadith, the Bible (Old Testament), some opinions of great islamic scholars of the past, a book by Karen Armstrong "Islam: A Short History", a book "Muhammad, His Biography Based on Earliest Sources". Some parts are derived from youtube lectures of sheikhs of our time (mostly Yasir Qadhi and Omar Suleiman) without providing the original source. I tried to stick to aforementioned sources. Mostly it is copy-paste, I have gathered the information, currated it, combined together and did some editing.



Recently, there seems to be increased awareness and fascination with the end of the world. People of many faiths are starting to think the signs of the last day are all around them, with Christians pointing to some biblical prophecies coming to light, or Jews now ‘back’ in Jerusalem, anticipating the return of their ‘Messiah’.

It is also widely thought amongst many erudite Islamic scholars that we are in the final throes of the last days before the Hour. After all, 

you have to learn about your religion in order to be able to defend your beliefs. and in the first place defend it against your own doubts. otherwise, there is a high probability that you will lose it by time or you will get astray.

hedonism, love for this dunya is a black hole.
