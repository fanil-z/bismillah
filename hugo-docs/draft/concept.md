## Description


maybe make the first post short.

I'll make a separate post about how the stack behind the website works. Shortly, it is build on the Hugo framework with Hyas 


Hello everyone and Assalamu Aleikum,

In order to get some Hugo and CSS practice, I started wrapping up my notes about Islam into a static website, carried away and after one year spending about 15min daily the MD editor showed it will take about 12 hours to read the whole thing.
When I started learning about Biblical and Islamic prophets 4-5 years ago, I had a hard time trying to figure out the historical order of the stories from religios texts. Also, Quran is not combined in the chronological order but in the order that was defined by the prophet Muhammad SAW. That's why the main idea was to gather and currate stories of all prophets mentioned in the Quran and sahih hadith in one page and sort them according to a historical timeline.

Another aspect that always bothers me in large documentation samples is that it is not easy to create a proper helicopter view of the whole thing. TOC helps you to navigate but doesn't give a summary. However in terms of historical texts, TOC can actually kind of give you a short description of what happened in the correct order. Trying to combine the helicopter view and large portions of text, I've used the standard <details><summary> tags so that details about a historic event appears when you click on the topic.

To build the website, I used the Hugo static HTML generator. Hugo is open-source, flexible; it has a large number of themes including themes for user manuals and API references. A good candidate if you want to implement the docs-as-code concept in your documentation department.

The overall stack looks like this:

1. Hugo: a static web-site generator builds a static HTML/CSS/JS website using MD files as a source.
	- Hyas: I used the Hyas theme to have a good-looking, neat bootstrap layout.
		- Hyas depends on Node.js. I installed it on my laptop.
		  Node.js is easy to install on Linux and probably Mac. On Windows, you will also need Chocolatey.
	- Doks theme
		- CSS: The theme is cool but I needed to adjust it to my purposes. So, I added the custom CSS file (~150 lines).
		- JS: added buttons for sending feedback, expanding/hiding details elements all at once, in-page search and dark mode switch toggle.
		- Hugo is super-flexible and has a large amount of useful features but at the beginning it was hard to navigate through all the functionality and figure out which exactly config files I had to change. Hugo documentation is helpful here. 
2. Render or Netlify: static web-files are hosted on Render. up to 100GB bandwisth a month is free. And 400 total build hours per month for free services and static sites.
3. A pipeline on render automatically fetches my latest commit in the git repo, installs all required npm packages, builds the website and pushes it to production. You can configure a test server on Render but I just test on production.

I bought the domain here:
4. 
5. Markdown: the content is written in Markdown files + with some HTML additions.
6. GitLab: source files for content + CSS, JS, themes are stored in GitLab.


btw last year I realized that my father's name Gilmetdeen translates from Arabic as "Knowledge of the religion" so I bought this domain.

Hugo has good documentation, but custom themes mostly written by front-end enthusiasts almost don't have documentation, which leaves you to reverse engineer the setup. I wouldn't recommend Hyas/Doks for beginners or if you want to customize the layout or CSS, there are much simpler themes of Hugo that can be configured in 5 min.

gathered from various web resources:
Islam: A Short History by Karen Armstrong who is a famous historian and a Christian nun.
my notes on Yasir Qadhi's 114 lectures on seerah of the Prophet Muhammad SAW are scattered within corresponding sections. Some info is taken from Wikipedia, which is always helpful and well-structured. I tried to edit them, remove the parts that are not mentioned in The Quran or authentic hadiths, or parts that are too Shia. Also, I started to create summaries of some sections and reorganize them, but decided to publish it as is hoping that some day I can edit it to the okay state. 

Please send your feedback to islam-wiki@proton.me if the order is not correct or if you find something conradicting the Quran or authentic hadith.

Probably I wouldn't be able to finish the the website if the content was not about Islam which is exciting to explore. However the most painful part was to gather information on the First Fitnah and how the era of righteous khalifs came to an end after assassination of Ali. Even though the Golden Age of Islam starts right after, for me it is the saddest periods of Islamic history, when we can say that the original ummah of the Prophet Muhammad ceased to exist. May Allah forgive us and guide us to the right path.

I also had to spend additional time adding a cat üêà every time the name of the noble Abu Huraira comes up because, verily, Abu Huraira that stands for "Father of a kitten" in Arabic. Was totally worth it and I do not consider it as israf of time.

After realizing that you can do so many things without a web server but just with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I really started to like the simplicity of what's happening behind the building and hosting process.
Well, maybe the fact that I know very little about building a web server plays a significant role here as well.

I really need to finish the Eschatonian part, for now it's hard to figure out the order of events in the signs of Day of Judgement and Al Qiyamah itself. So the section has the [TBD] tag. Actually, The Apocalypse and jinns (spirits and devils) are two topics that I find the most interest among non-Muslim people as well.

The main page markdown file is 8000 lines. Islam teaches to finish what you started, so I tried to spend on this at least 20 minutes a day. Slowly it got into shape, Alhamdulillah. I had some good time trying to gather particles of an endless puzzle.
but there are still many bugs left.
I have many doubts like was Thamud earlier than 'Ad or vice versa.

hugo is a good choice if you want to implement docs-as-code approach and if the documentation team is ready to work with markdown instead of traditional XML editors.
I've been editing raw markdown files for a while until I found about https://github.com/marktext/marktext which is open source and really nice. has a spell checker.

https://github.com/mundimark/awesome-markdown-editors

90k words, 6000 paragraphs.
My Ghostwriter editor says the reading time of the whole thing is 6 hours. I wonder how much time I've spent there.

I need to relisten some lectures from Seerah of prophet Muhammad SAW and finish the History of Islam section.

Wanted to combine the guide from interlinked separate parts where each definition can be source for its own wiki page. hugo has functionality for snippets but seemed like it would require one-level higher content planning and too much overhead so I chose the simplest way.

Published on Render: https://islam-wiki.onrender.com/docs/wiki/islam-wiki

It it truly amazing that nowadays we can read about any historic event just sitting on a couch and listen to khutbas and lectures of best sheikhs.


### Note on CSS

THe website wouldn't get the bootstrap css from @hyas node on production builds. I don't know how to fix it, so I just implemented added an additional custom CSS file in the head.html. Using this approach I can actually just use a simple hugo theme and bump the CSS there. I don't know. 

### On this page
[tableOfContents]
  endLevel = 4
  ordered = false
  startLevel = 1

### Disabling TOC

# NEXT STEPS

1. Generate arts using Stable Diffusion. 

https://www.howtogeek.com/830179/how-to-run-stable-diffusion-on-your-pc-to-generate-ai-images/

Requirements:
* All pics must be in one style.
* Maybe pixelart.

2. Recently I became a fan of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool) and how they play with CSS and JS to create interactive data visuals like for example [this article about Aztec mythology](https://pudding.cool/2022/06/aztec-gods/).

3. Reduce the size of the website to 1,5MB.
https://habr.com/ru/company/ruvds/blog/692840/
My friend sent me this blog post about how people make 14KB websites and 56byte stylesheets, and I realized that 2 png images are occupying 91% of my network traffic. It helped me to reduce the weight from 10MB to 2,2MB, which might actually help me remain inside kosten-frei 100GB per month limit in Render.
	* remove unused css.
	* buttons and scripts.

4. Add timeline.





[OLD] I have some thoughts on how to make it user-friendly for mobile users. probably this will require some changes in the H1 structure. For example, we can put the H1 child content inside the details tag and then hide all the content. so that mobile users will se only the H1 headers and they will need to click the header to expand its child H2 headers. This will make it minimalistic and more interactive.

Also, we can remove te on this page section at all as it is useless anyway. instead we can add a button for different depths. For example, show only H1 headers, show h1 & h2 headers, and expand all.


Need to do
===========
## STAGE 1. World History Map (General) 
***************************

1. [DONE] Come up with the concept. Some algorithm to make it convenient to read and to support.
	* [DONE] maybe just switch to Hugo as it seems more convenient and versatile:
		* hugo-doks +
		* hugo-book
		* hugo-learn
		* A bad thing about choosing a custom theme is that it may end up not supporting some of the functions that you need and you will learn about it very late in the game and it will be too troublesome to change to some other theme. Also, hugo has documentation, but the themes which in most cases have a bunch of their own code and functions have a very general-level docuentation. I guess mostly because the themes were created by volunteering front-end developers and not by technical writers. that's why these things are smart and dynamic but without instructions.
2. Copy-paste topics.
3. Fact-check and rewrite the topics. 
4. - Buy a hosting place. Just upload to Render.
5. Buy a domain.
5. [DONE] add some images or emoji
6. [DON-] write a disclaimer


## STAGE 2. World History Map (Technical Tasks)

* Need index-numbers and maybe certain div classes for titles and descriptions.
* Send Feedback button
* add favicon
* [DONE] add head menu with links
* [DONE] add custom css
* find how to build a static website with config
	seems like I need to upload it somewhere and fix the baseurl in config before it starts to work locally without serve.
* [DONE] find a way to deal with bootstrap CSS
* [DONE] deal with the TOC (how did I do that?)
* [DONE] attach the upper panel (position: sticky)
* [DONE] expand all toggle (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43008609/expanding-all-details-tags)
	* Maybe also make this a switch-toggle instead of a button.
* dark mode toggle slider: https://infomate.club/howtoberlin/
* sticky panel include: dark mode toggle, expand all toggle, back to Home link, ?search, ?git link
* change the upper line gradient color
* add a timeline since Ibrahim. now there's no way I can hack bootstrap css on that level
* [DONE] fix CSS for This-Page-TOC background and border in the bootstrap CSS.
* add button to go up to the beginning: 
* [DONE] incorporate search in the current page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51988459/html-searching-on-the-same-page/51988637
* put search button inside search field
* -- Try GitLab Pages. Seems like it's free compared to GitHub Pages. (Free but you need to provide your CC data.)
* Do Expand All when clicking a section in the TOC
* [DONE] Create a mockup for timeline-helicopter view of the seerah of Prophet Muhammad sww.


Dark mode switch: https://dev.to/ahmadbassamemran/awesome-animation-checkbox-css-toggle-day-night-mode-5dnm




### Other Stuff
* https://www.islam-guide.com/truth.htm maybe contact them and fix their CSS.
* add the "Useful Links" section


## Notes
* **expand all** script is in layout/docs/single.html
* the menu, buttons, Expand All in the layout/partials/header/header.html
* To fix CSS, use files from the /scss/common directory.
seems like my sense of beauty is inevitably falling behind my willingness to fix all CSS issues.



border-image-source: linear-gradient(
89deg, #067f11e3, #05ffcab3 50%, #4fe622ab);

<label class="switch">
  <input type="checkbox">
  <span class="slider round"></span>
</label>


JS scripts are in single.html. Need to transform them to separate scripts in the js folder.




Sections
===========
1. Ultimate Roadmap of the Universe According to Islam
2. Seerah of the Prophet Muhammad sww with timeline-helicopter view (REST API documentation style) 
2. Interactive chart with the Prophets family.
3. Islam and Science (Scientific Miracles of the Quran)
4. Synopsis for each episode of the seerah of the prophet Muhammad saw
5. Comparison with other religions
6. [God's creation compared to computer programming]
7. Maybe make the interactive chart of connections like in Infinite Jest.
8. Interactive diagram of how persons good and bad deeds are collected by angels and sent to Jannah and Jahannam where they obtain some form.

## Hosting

Deploy your static site easily on Render.

Just Link GitLab or GitHub repository, and let it build your website and serve it on a global CDN. The best thing is that static sites are free on Render with no additional cost of up to 100 GB bandwidth a month.
