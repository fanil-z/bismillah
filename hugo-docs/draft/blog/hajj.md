# How to perform Hajj


when a person decides to do pilgrimage and undertakes this journey, he becomes a guest of Allah.

Never shaitan is more humiliated than in the Day of Arafah

every step that he takes he is raised one level.

resurrecting what Ibrahim did 4000 years ago.

when the person does the final tawwaf, it is as if he is pure as his monther gave birth to him.

The true Hajj has no reward other than Jannah.

Umar said those who have means to go to Hajj and didn't go, I might as well put jizyah on them.

ask Sherry about his umrah


It is weird to write about hajj. sometimes I just imagine myself entering ikhram or on the Mount Arafat and start crying. It gets emotional when you feel that the prophet Muhammad SAW went through the same steps. In Islam, intention is more important than the result. and if I die tomorrow and if my intention to make hajj is sincere, then it means that my hajj will already be accepted and I will die as a hajji even without going to hajj.

O good people, please wish that Allah accepts my hajj.
