# Overview
-----------------------------------------------

The Hajj to Mecca in Saudi Arabia is considered the world's largest human gathering with almost 2.5 million pilgrims in 2019.

# Kaaba and Hajj Background
-----------------------------------------------
<details><summary>

## Some earliest reports about Kaaba

</summary>
Some reports teach that it was in Makkah that our father Adam (‘alayhi al-salam) longed to go back to paradise and be in the presence of Allah. To console his loneliness, Allah commanded him to do tawaf around the space of the current Ka‘bah. And Adam did, and felt whole again.

Other texts teach that Nuh (’alayhi al-salam), Ibrahim (’alayhi al-salam), and many prophets before them (’alayhim al-salam), all did tawaf around Allah’s sacred House.

Their spiritual energy and legacy fills the air. You will be walking in the footsteps and the heart-steps of Rasulullah (sallalahu ’alayhi wasallam) and his noble companions.

when a person decides to do pilgrimage and undertakes this journey, he becomes a guest of Allah.

Never shaitan is more humiliated than in the Day of Arafah

every step that he takes he is raised one level.

resurrecting what Ibrahim did 4000 years ago.

when the person does the final tawwaf, it is as if he is pure as his monther gave birth to him.

The true Hajj has no reward other than Jannah.

Umar said those who have means to go to Hajj and didn't go, I might as well put jizyah on them.

## What happened last year (in 2021)

Last year, after 2 years of no-Hajj and one year of 2.6mln hajjis, Saudi Arabia decided to take over all organizational part in their own hands.

8,500 euro for 2 weeks, and the "fancy hotel". But Wallahi, who needs a fancy hotel if you go to Hajj.

registering on the website: https://www.motawif.com.sa/home/en-sa

I've talked to 3 Hajj & Umrah agencies in Berlin and all three confirmed that Hajj of 2021 was a disaster and "miserable". Pretty much everyone was unhappy. The Agencies because they couldn't send organized groups; the hajji's because everything was disorganized, people got lost, didn't know what to do and some times relatives who came together were paced in different hotels and etc etc; and the Saudi Arabia wasn't happy because instead of 2.6 million only 800,000 hajjis came. So, hopefully, this year there will be some new rulings. Inshaallah.

Egyptian brothers say that there is literraly a lottery played by the goverment and the winner goes to Mesjit Al-Haram.

Still, the result is the same. You fulfill the fifth pillar of Islam. and if you've done everything right, then you are forgiven. and now you can start it over from a clean sheet of paper. and you followed the footsteps of our prophet Muhammad SAW. and you have been a guest of Ar Rahman Ar Raheem. Oh Allah, please accept our Hajj.

[Valuable Tips for Hajj](https://www.islamicity.org/12445/getting-ready-for-hajj-physically-mentally-and-spiritually/)

Make sa’i (the walk between the hills of Safa and Marwa) on the 4th floor roof extension area, which is usually empty and has a wonderful view during Fajr (pre-dawn prayer) time.

few people would remind themselves saying, “La jidaal,” or “No arguing,”

make incessant talbiyah [Labbayk Allahuma labbayk - I respond to Your call O Allah, I respond to Your call], and embody your submission to Allah (swt).

Use the full day of Arafah for worship—not just the time after Asr (late afternoon prayer).

The Prophet ﷺ  used to make dua the entire day and intensified the supplication after Asr.

Side point: plan to avoid the bathrooms at Muzdalifah.  Eat and drink accordingly and use the bathrooms in Arafah before getting on the bus to Muzdalifah.

An experienced Hajji advised: “Treat tawaf  (walking 7 times around the Kabah) like prayer and strive for khushoo [concentration].” The virtue of tawaf is well known: it is recommended to perform tawaf in the Haram before praying 2 rakahs (units of prayer) as the ‘greeting’ of the masjid! One idea is to pick different dua or prayers for each round, or to pick the first round for seeking forgiveness, the second round for making dua for the community, etc. Performing tawaf can be a struggle given all the distractions. Try to avoid congested areas and the 2nd floor wheelchair drivers (who go fast and end up hitting peoples’ ankles).  One recommendation is to avoid the first and second floor and only make tawaf and sai on the relatively un-crowded rooftop.
Ask Allah for help.

The footage depicts for me some descriptions of the Day of Judgement when all people are gathered in the gathering place. they are all dressed the same all in the same state and doesn't care about the surrounding people, they only care about their salvation. 

It is weird to write about hajj. sometimes I just imagine myself entering ikhram or on the Mount Arafat and start crying. It gets emotional when you feel that the prophet Muhammad SAW went through the same steps. If a person goes to Hajj and performs all required steps properly and sincerely, then he is forgiven and he will return back clean from sins as a newborn child. In Islam, intention is more important than the result. and if I die tomorrow and if my intention to make hajj is sincere, then it means that my hajj will already be accepted and I will die as a hajji even without going to hajj.

O good people, please wish that Allah accepts my hajj.

It is still 240 days till hajj
