The very first question that comes to mind "How did that happen?"

And about the unclothed king .
One of biggest things that I don't get in economics is the big how, how on earth all these collective brains of governments of the most developed countries agreed to work with dollars. I guess the easiest trick is the simplest. It's almost like people thought ðŸ¤”hmm okay they are printing money out of paper and say it is as valuable as real goods, metals, cheeseburgers, cars, engineers.. probably there's something that I don't understand. They definitely have some fundamental reasons to think that it is a right way to treat money. Otherwise, this would be an insanity, right? Who would believe that and go for it if it wasn't a smart thing. 
Unfortunately the truth is that it is insanity indeed. And what is worse, everyone goes for it. If there is a politician who tells that dollar is fake, there's no way he can convince about the seriousness of the situation to his colleagues.
The thing is that for so many years now, we have a fake king. And people see that it works so they create their own fake kings. The colonial world did not go anywhere.
And I want to tell what is the worst outcome of the fake king in my opinion. And this is a very simple logic. The more dollars they print the poorer the underdeveloped countries become. It is just pure logic. If you have a fake currency that is used worldwide and there's a country that has an infinite source of this currency, it means that countries that can't print dollars will always be losers. No chance. They just have no chance. 
I think I am not wrong that this is a hypocrisy when US gives money to fight hunger in Africa. Yes, most of these countries had their own issues but it is the dollar who made these countries non-competitive.
That's what China is doing now. Adopting the same system of printing money. 
We are doomed or Live in an erroneous system of unending financial pyramids.
And the same as a bad fake king inevitable causes appearance of some opposition,  it is us itself who caused the invention of Bitcoin. People got educated and learned computers.
Hipsters who knew the idea how the monetary system works now have tools to put the candy in a shining colorful paper and invented even a simpler solution. They don't even need paper to print money. They just say hey look I got billion dollars in my account  and to prove that this Bitcoin can be used to buy bread all of you must buy it from me and then buy bread from each other. 
The wrong point in this algorithm is that there is no justice in this system from the very beginning.

Allah calls us to be just. And sometimes it is hard to define your place in all this because you as a person is brought to life in a corrupt system you get education, u learn how to work and get the idea that to have a family home and food you need to work for the system and be a small cog in the machine. in this system that is build on the corrupt principle. There is just hardly any other way. Your money would still be considered halal. But if you think about it, it raises questions that are scared to think of.

Income is still halal but it is important to know where u are it is important to know the price of this dunya.
Financial pyramids.
Was he genius financist? No, he was mediocre. Were they evil and did they cause corruption? Yes, for a large scale. You don't need to be smart to be filthy rich, you only need to choose the dark oath and embrace evil.
I wrote all these to make only one conclusion. And this is Hadith from Abu Huraira, who is knows to reject how house and wealth and come live in the mosque in Medina and learn how to be a Muslim from the prophet Muhammad himself sas.
This dunya is cursed. 
For you as a person, It is cursed from your very first breath.
very beginning of your life. The only way to not fall the victim if the corrupt system is not to follow it's course. 
The answer is very simple. Very simple.
Follow the way of God.

Any progress in technology is led by chipping in of many people. So, in the system without inflation mechanisms such as ribba, you cannot convince someone to lend you money so that you can return him 105% next year. You need to think of some value that you can offer. 
 you need to convince as much people as you can that building of this huge factory that will require so many resources and will be finished by the time your Enkel finish school is worth it. This is investing. Very different from riba.
This was the way how caravans worked in pre Islamic Arabia. People gave money to the caravan chiefs so that they use this money to buy something from one place and then sell it in the other.
It's a fair trade. If a supply of certain goods is plenty in one region then it's price will be cheap. But in the other regions it will be valuable. This is a fair trade.

If the system was fair the progress would not be that destructive and will be much slower.

The thing with cryptocurrency is that it moves towards making the real worth of a coin less and less. With new coins you don't even have to waste electricity. Proof of stake. Just buy some coins and get dividends just because you have some coins that almost have no value. 
It is a scary tool when it gets to hands of federal state.  cryptodollar and cryptoyuan will be so simple as typing 9digit numbers on your calculator and declaring that "I am the rich now, see?" And people who don't see and have arguments about the injustice in the system will get some hard time. 
Special agencies can erase their balance on the big calculator and say hey look you can't buy house now and actually we added you deficit equity, you have minus balance now, how are you gonna pay. Probably will take everything that u have and put u in jail because this is our job and other agency will add some balance in our calculator so that my kids can go to college.

And what God has to say about this fundamentally economic issue of a modern world?
Allah calls it ribba and condemns it and considers it a sin. AS simple as that. Humans built the trade and financial system and defined terms of the economy. But God know economy better than us alltogether collected.

I had some discussions with people who didnt consider ribba as something bad. What is bad if you just give money to the bank and they use it to give mortgages to other people? The bad thing is that it is only the beginning of inflation. Inflation nowadays is considered something good when it does not exceed couple % a year, and okayish if it doesn't reach a two-digit number. The thing is that inflation is an injustice in its nature. 
Who cares, right?
Yes, I dont have a degree in economics but you don't need to finish Yale to laugh at Pinoccio fooled by anthropomorphic Cat Basilio and his fox companion to burry his coins under the tree.
