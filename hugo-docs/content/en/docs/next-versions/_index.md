# POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS

1. Generate arts using Stable Diffusion. 

https://www.howtogeek.com/830179/how-to-run-stable-diffusion-on-your-pc-to-generate-ai-images/

Requirements:
* All pics must be in one style.
* Maybe pixelart.

2. Recently I became a fan of [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool) and how they play with CSS and JS to create interactive data visuals like for example [this article about Aztec mythology](https://pudding.cool/2022/06/aztec-gods/).

3. Add timeline.

4. I have some thoughts on how to make it user-friendly for mobile users. probably this will require some changes in the H1 structure. For example, we can put the H1 child content inside the details tag and then hide all the content. so that mobile users will se only the H1 headers and they will need to click the header to expand its child H2 headers. This will make it minimalistic and more interactive.

Also, we can remove te on this page section at all as it is useless anyway. instead we can add a button for different depths. For example, show only H1 headers, show h1 & h2 headers, and expand all.

5. Web Server

### Other Stuff
* https://www.islam-guide.com/truth.htm maybe contact them and fix their CSS.
* add the "Useful Links" section



finish the Eschatonian part, for now it's hard to figure out the order of events in the signs of Day of Judgement and Al Qiyamah itself. So the section has the [TBD] tag. Actually, The Apocalypse and jinns (spirits and devils) are two topics that I find the most interest among non-Muslim people as well.

I need to relisten some lectures from Seerah of prophet Muhammad SAW and finish the History of Islam section.

Wanted to combin the guide from interlinked separate parts where each definition can be source for its own wiki page. hugo has functionality for snippets but seemed like it would require one-level higher content planning and too much overhead so I chose the simplest way.
